The major\nrelease of the open-source cloud-native edge router comes as Traefik recently\ncrossed 1 billion software downloads from Docker Hub. This 2.0 release builds\nupon the wildly successful initial version of Traefik and is Containous' most\nsignificant release to date. This new release gives software development teams\neven more control and networking capabilities for their applications.\n\nWith containerized microservices environments becoming more and more complex to\nmanage, enterprises increasingly need better management and visibility within\ntheir production applications. Traefik 2.0 combines advanced routing\nconfigurations with a better developer experience, and includes TCP routing\nsupport for managing broader application protocols. Based on the same\nstraightforward design principles of Traefik, the 2.0 release delivers\nengineering teams an all-in-one platform to manage and monitor traffic.\n\nThis release includes a number of new features across three key areas:\n\n * TCP routing support (and SNI routing) -- Traefik 2.0 supports both HTTP\n   requests and TCP requests. Developers can now not only route classic API\n   calls, but also route requests to a broader application support, such as\n   databases or any TCP-based applications.\n * Advanced routing capabilities -- This version enables Canary Deployments and\n   A/B testing with service load balancers, and gives developers the ability to\n   fully customize their routes with middleware. Traefik 2.0 also allows\n   mirroring services, a way to fork the incoming request and send it to\n   different services at the same time, as well as fine-grained configuration\n   for TLS termination to define TLS termination parameters per route.\n * Better developer experience -- Traefik 2.0 gives developers a brand new API\n   that provides detailed status and traffic information about what’s happening\n   in the cluster. The version also comes with a clear configuration with CRD in\n   Kubernetes for better readability and control over configuration, a Go-Like\n   syntax for router rules, more configuration consistency with Labels, and YAML\n   support. A new WebUI enables developers to see what is happening on their\n   cluster at a glance, and a refactored documentation includes all possible\n   configuration examples.\n\n“Our mission with Traefik 2.0 is to support our users through their entire\nnetworking journey, from connecting any of their applications, to controlling\naccess, to monitoring traffic,” said Emile Vauge, founder and CEO of Containous.\n“We have a vision of building a single, complete solution that simplifies the\nnetworking complexity associated with designing, deploying, and managing\napplications. Traefik 2.0 is a major milestone and significant step, and\nsurpassing 1 billion downloads is a great testament to Traefik’s ability to help\ncustomers on that journey.”\n\nThe recently announced Maesh [/maesh/], Containous’ service mesh, has been built\non top of version 2 of Traefik. Together, Traefik and Maesh bring an integrated\nand full-featured networking solution for cloud-native infrastructures.\n\nAvailability\n\nDownload Traefik 2.0 on Docker Hub [https://hub.docker.com/_/traefik].\n\nResources:\n\n * Traefik website [/traefik/]\n * Containous blog post on Traefik 2.0 [/blog/traefik-2-0-6531ec5196c2/]\n * Traefik documentation [https://docs.traefik.io/]\n * GitHub repository [https://github.com/containous/traefik]\n * Visit Containo.us [/]\n * Follow @Containous [https://twitter.com/containous] on Twitter\n\nAbout Containous\n\nContainous [/] brings the future of cloud-native networking by offering powerful\ntools to ease the deployment of your modern IT environments.
