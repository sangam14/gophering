With this certification, TraefikEE joins the Red Hat software\ncertified partner ecosystem and is readily available through Red Hat OpenShift\n[https://www.openshift.com/products/container-platform], the industry’s most\ncomprehensive enterprise Kubernetes platform.\n\nModern enterprises are turning to containerized environments to gain agility in\nthe development of their applications. But this paradigm introduces complexity\naround networking that developers now need to mitigate through the use of many\ndiscrete tools that cannot be integrated easily or efficiently. Through its\ncentralized and automated platform, TraefikEE brings operational efficiency,\nhigh availability, increased delivery speed at scale in dynamic container\necosystems, and centralized tooling for even the largest enterprise\narchitectures. Now independent software vendors (ISVs) and Red Hat OpenShift\ncustomers can simplify the deployment, management, and scaling of applications\nthrough TraefikEE’s popular edge routing technology. The TraefikEE Operator is\nbuilt on top of Traefik [/traefik/] – the open source solution that is one of\nGitHub’s top-ten most popular projects, with more than 1.5 billion downloads.\n\nRed Hat OpenShift [https://www.openshift.com/products/container-platform] is a\nenterprise Kubernetes application platform trusted by more than 1500\norganizations to power cloud-native deployments across the hybrid cloud.\nOperators are a key component to the Red Hat OpenShift ecosystem, providing\n“as-a-service” automation at every level of the stack. Red Hat OpenShift uses\nthe power of Operators to run the entire platform in an autonomous fashion while\nexposing configuration natively through Kubernetes objects, allowing for quicker\ninstallation and more frequent updates. In addition to the automation advantages\nof Operators for managing the platform, Red Hat OpenShift makes it easier to\nfind, install and manage Operators running on clusters.\n\n“Providing the TraefikEE Operator to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform\nenables many more enterprises to simplify otherwise complex networking,” said\nGérald Croës, VP Engineering, Containous. “Businesses are looking for easy and\ncentralized ways to deploy and manage their applications. TraefikEE provides\npeace of mind when running critical applications in production, without\nrequiring any compromise on security or capacity to scale deployments.  This is\na modern reverse proxy built for the cloud, and we’re thrilled to earn\ncertification and make our TraefikEE Operator part of the Red Hat OpenShift\nworld.”\n\n“As a Red Hat-certified Operator for Red Hat OpenShift, the TraefikEE Operator\nfrom Containous is now part of the Red Hat Partner Connect ecosystem, providing\nbroader choice to our customers and ISVs,” said Julio Tapia, senior director,\nCloud Platforms ecosystem, Red Hat. “Kubernetes Operators help encode the human\noperational logic normally required to manage services running as a\nKubernetes-native application and aim to make day-to-day operations easier.
