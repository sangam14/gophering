Built on top of Traefik, the popular cloud-native\nedge router used by the world’s largest web companies, Maesh is designed from\nthe ground up to be lightweight, easy to use, and full featured – helping\ndevelopers connect, secure and monitor traffic to and from their\nmicroservices-based applications.\n\nMicroservices, and its multiple organizational benefits, have become the defacto\napproach to building applications in the enterprise. However, as network\ncommunications in these dynamic environments get increasingly complex, service\nmeshes are becoming a critical part of every microservice deployment. With\nservice meshes, developers and operations teams have the ability to manage\ninter-service communication within a single management layer.\n\nMaesh facilitates the adoption of microservices and improves the service mesh\nexperience for developers by offering an easy way to connect, secure and monitor\nthe network traffic in any Kubernetes environment. Maesh eliminates\ncommunication complexity by monitoring and tracing application communications\nwithin Kubernetes clusters. Developers are able to optimize internal traffic,\nvisualize traffic patterns, and secure communication channels, all while\nimproving application performance.\n\nUnlike other service mesh technologies – and based upon Traefik’s original\ndesign principles of simplicity – Maesh can be installed and up and running\nwithin minutes. Developers can drastically reduce the time needed to connect and\nmonitor their services and can instead focus on implementing business logic\nwithin their applications. And while many service meshes take an invasive “all\nor nothing” approach to adoption, Maesh is designed to be completely\nnon-invasive, allowing development teams across the organization to\nincrementally “opt-in” applications progressively over time.\n\nBacked by Traefik’s rich feature-set, Maesh enables critical features across any\nKubernetes environment: Observability (OpenTracing, Metrics), Multi-Protocol\nSupport (HTTP layer and TCP layer), Traffic Management (load balancing, retries\n& fail-overs, circuit breakers & rate limits), and Security and Safety (access\ncontrols). Maesh is also Service Mesh Interface (SMI) compliant, a standard\nspecification for service mesh interoperability in Kubernetes.\n\n“With Maesh, Containous continues to innovate with the mission to drastically\nsimplify cloud-native adoption for all enterprises,” said Emile Vauge, CEO,\nContainous. “We’ve been proud of how popular Traefik has been for developers as\na critical open source solution, and we’re excited to now bring them Maesh.”\n\nResources:\n\n * Maesh website [/maesh/]\n * Maesh documentation [https://docs.mae.sh/]\n * GitHub repository [https://github.com/containous/maesh]\n * Containous blog post on Maesh release [/blog/maesh-1-0-802f4be9a9a7/]\n * Visit Containo.us [/]\n * Follow @Containous [https://twitter.com/containous] on Twitter\n\nAbout Containous\nContainous brings the future of software architecture by offering powerful tools\nto ease the deployment of your modern IT environments.
