We’re creating a simple, unified stack that can be\nused to manage the entire network across data centers, on-premises servers and\npublic clouds all the way out to the edge.”\n\nTraefik Labs developed the Traefik application proxy as a cloud-native\nalternative to traditional solutions, which lacked features like service\ndiscovery, automation and autoscaling—all of which were important to enterprises\nadopting microservices. Traefik quickly became popular for its ease of use, open\nsource architecture and native support for cluster technologies including\nDocker, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, Mesos and many more.\n\n“We created Traefik because we needed application networking that could handle\nthe complexity and scale of the cloud. It turned out, a lot of other people\nwanted the same thing: open source networking built from the ground up for\nDevOps and microservices. Since Traefik is at the heart of everything we do, it\nwas natural to make it the heart of our identity as well,” Vauge said.\n\nTraefik has won the trust of some of the world’s largest online businesses,\nincluding Conde Nast, eBay Classifieds and Mailchimp, amassing 30,000 stars on\nGitHub. \n\n“I wish all networking software were designed as well as Traefik,” said Pierre\nBourgeois, DevOps engineer at Worldline. “You definitely can configure the most\nadvanced ingress rules you may need; sometimes you have to get into the details,\nbut most of the time you just need your edge router to work—especially with the\ncloud and microservices, where environments are constantly changing. With\nTraefik, I don’t waste time configuring settings. Traefik finds my services and\nconfigures itself. In terms of usability and performance, it’s head and\nshoulders over any popular solution I’ve seen.”\n\nBuilding on the success of Traefik, Traefik Labs has developed a range of\nproducts extending the capabilities of its core projects. The complete list\nincludes:\n\n * Traefik Proxy (‘Traefik’), the original open-source application proxy for\n   cloud-native platforms, which provides load balancing, API gateway services\n   and ingress control.\n * Traefik Mesh (formerly Maesh), an open-source service mesh featuring Traefik\n   Labs’ signature ease of use and a unique per-node architecture.\n * Traefik Enterprise, Traefik Labs’ flagship open-core offering, which bundles\n   Traefik Proxy and Traefik Mesh along with additional features for scale,\n   security, support and deployment.\n * Traefik Pilot (new), a centralized SaaS control center and plug-in hub for\n   Traefik servers. \n\n“The growth of cloud-native architectures made Traefik Pilot essential,” Vauge\nsaid. “Enterprises aren’t just experimenting with containers and microservices\nanymore. They’re in full production, with clusters around the world. Traefik\nPilot makes it easy to run Traefik as it was meant to be run: at cloud scale.”\n\nTraefik Pilot provides observability, security and monitoring of Traefik’s\ncloud-native application proxy. Users can quickly set alerts and see real-time\nreports on the health and status of each Traefik instance, while Traefik Pilot\nautomatically checks for common vulnerabilities and exposure (CVE) bulletins and\nflags any that might need attention. \n\nTraefik Pilot’s innovative new plug-in hub also enables anyone to create,\npublish and install add-on packages that extend Traefik’s functionality.\nDevelopers can write plug-ins in Go and share them with the community as easily\nas publishing them on GitHub. Traefik Pilot users can find plug-ins directly\nfrom the catalog without compiling a single line of code. \n\n“Traefik Pilot opens up Traefik so developers can tailor it to their own needs\nand make the entire platform more capable,” Vauge said. “What makes Traefik\npowerful and even fun to use is that it provides both simplicity and\nflexibility. Traefik automates complexity away, and Traefik Pilot makes the\nnetworking stack infinitely extensible.”\n\nOver time, Traefik Labs plans to make Traefik Pilot the control center for the\nentire Traefik networking stack.\n\n“Without the right tools and approach, networking in the cloud native world is\nnotoriously complex,” said Greg Muscarella, VP of Automation and Operations\nProducts at Nutanix. “There’s a real need for a cloud-native network stack that\nfits together seamlessly, which is why our new Kubernetes-based multicloud PaaS,\nKarbon Platform Services, offers Traefik as an integrated service that\ndevelopers can easily leverage for content-based routing, load balancing and\nSSL/TLS termination. Traefik Labs’ strong focus on simplicity and ease of use\naligns with Nutanix’s goal of enabling enterprises to fast-track their\ncloud-native journey.”\n\nTraefik Labs announced $10M in Series A funding in January 2020, led by\nBalderton Capital, with participation from Elaia and 360 Capital Partners.\n\nAbout Traefik Labs\nTraefik Labs [https://traefik.io/] develops the world’s most popular\ncloud-native application networking software.
