And, it\n   relies on encrypted communications between nodes to add an extra layer of\n   security.\n * Smooth Operations: TraefikEE comes with an additional CLI that manages to\n   deploy and operate a cluster with several nodes in only one command line.\n   Currently, Kubernetes and Docker Swarm Mode are supported.\n * Dashboard: TraefikEE comes with a dashboard to visualize your cluster nodes\n   configuration and status, in addition to aggregated data plane metrics.\n * Global Support Services: TraefikEE provides enterprise-class technical\n   support to help you reduce risk, optimize productivity, and ensure success,\n   with direct access to the core Traefik team.\n\n“We are thrilled to announce the General Availability of TraefikEE.
