The event took place over three days on a Discord server that\nincluded contributors from around the world. Over 50 individuals joined the\nevent and contributed several new plugins for Traefik, multiple bug fixes for\nYaegi, and new features and capabilities for Traefik itself. This event was the\nfirst time Traefik Labs officially organized a hackathon. We couldn’t be more\npleased with the collaboration between first-time contributors and long-time\nmaintainers within our community.\n\nContributions Are Welcome Here\nThere are two distinct categories of contributions for this event: new plugins\nfor Traefik Pilot [https://pilot.traefik.io/] and pull requests for our open\nsource projects Traefik [https://github.com/traefik/traefik] and Yaegi\n[https://github.com/traefik/yaegi]. Over a dozen individual contributors created\nnew plugins, and we were pleasantly surprised by contributions to our open\nsource projects in the form of new features, bug reports, and other\nimprovements.\n\nIn this post, I’ll cover the contributions that the team was most impressed with\nand which were awarded the grand prizes. In addition to the grand prizes,\nseveral others deserve mention for their collective efforts, and I’ll cover\nthose too! I want to give a special thanks to the engineering team at Traefik\nfor engaging with the community and working with them to bring their ideas to\nlife.\n\nThe entire team is looking forward to the next time we do this, and I’ll talk a\nlittle bit about that at the end of this post.\n\nThe Grand Prizes\nOne of the newest features of Traefik is support for adding customized\nfunctionality to the processing of requests handled by the Traefik Proxy. These\nare called Traefik Plugins, and nearly all ten bounties were claimed by our\ncontributors! Each of the grand prizes went to a team or individual who\ncontributed a plugin. The second prize has a bit of a caveat attached to it, but\nmore on that later.\n\nFirst Prize - Team Fail2Ban\nhttps://pilot.traefik.io/plugins/280093067746214409/fail2-ban\n\n [https://pilot.traefik.io/plugins/280093067746214409/fail2-ban]\n\nThe first prize went to a team that was formed by a few contributors who had\nearlier worked on another plugin named Header Transformation\n[https://pilot.traefik.io/plugins/279923829278507529/header-transformation] \n(more about that below). One of the contributors not only produced a great blog\npost [https://blog.moulard.org/traefik-hackaethon/] about their experience with\nthe event, but they came together to create a handy plugin that will block\nrequests originating from a source that fails to authenticate after a specific\nnumber of times. While the concept of Fail2ban\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail2ban] isn’t necessarily new, nor is the\nimplementation of it within a reverse proxy, this is the first time it’s become\naccessible without the use of external dependencies, complex iptables\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iptables], or integrations with commercial\npackages. The implementation is complete and functionality impressive, given the\ntight deadlines and scope of the plugin. Thank you to Tom and the team for\nputting together two great plugins.\n\nSecond Prize - Team Brotli\nhttps://github.com/traefik/yaegi/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Arsteube\n\n [https://github.com/traefik/yaegi/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Arsteube]\n\nThis plugin (that is still in progress) gets the second place award after the\ncreator worked to implement a compression algorithm ported entirely over to Go,\nwhich coincidentally helped us bring even more compatibility to our runtime Go\ninterpreter Yaegi [https://github.com/traefik/yaegi]. When we kicked off this\nHackathon, we knew that the underlying engine that interprets code in real time,\nusually compiled, is still considered experimental. That didn’t stop this\ncontributor. He worked all three days with Marc, the Yaegi project lead, to\nidentify and fix numerous issues they found while incorporating the ported\ncompression algorithm. This work led to several PRs and improvements made by the\nauthor and the Yaegi team. While the plugin wasn’t eligible for the plugin\nbounty, we felt his contributions to the Yaegi project were so impactful that\nthis contributor deserved the second grand prize.\n\nThird Prize - Team Containers On-Demand\nhttps://pilot.traefik.io/plugins/280027003970650633/containers-on-demand\n\n\n\nImagine being able to scale up services from zero with Traefik when the load\nbalancer receives a request. Two developers on this team hatched this idea\ntogether after discussing the concept and built a service that integrates with\nDocker Swarm to interact with the Docker API. The judges felt this plugin\ndeserved the grand prize for two distinct reasons: First, developers’\npersistence in finding a solution that works given the design constraints; and\nsecond, their creativity in deciding what to build. The plugin engine was\ncreated for users to be creative and bend Traefik in ways the developers at\nTraefik Labs might never have considered. This team’s contribution fits nicely\ninto the vision the team had.\n\nPlugin Bounties\nEach of the above plugins was awarded a bounty (except for Brotli, since it’s\ntechnically still a WIP), but there are a few plugins that deserve mention.\n\nTraefik Fault Injection\nhttps://pilot.traefik.io/plugins/279918789803378185/fault-injection\n\nPurposely introducing faults and errors into an environment is a practice known\nas chaos engineering. This plugin allows for failures to be induced\nprogrammatically via the load balancer. It can be used to purposely inject\nfailures of a specific type and rate to any service. Teams that are looking to\nbuild for resilience and solutions engineers who are looking to induce failures\nwithout having to modify application source code may find this plugin useful.\n\nHeader Transformation\nhttps://pilot.traefik.io/plugins/279923829278507529/header-transformation\n\nAuthored by Team Fail2ban, this plugin allows for headers to be modified based\non simple regex-based rulesets: Set, Rename, Del, and Join. Using these rules,\noperators can modify headers sent from the client before they reach their\nservice destination.\n\nDatadog Event\nhttps://pilot.traefik.io/plugins/280005610925195785/datadog-event\n\nOperators who install this plugin may generate an event in Datadog when a\nresponse code or contents matches a regex-based rule.\n\nOpen Source Contributions\nWe saw several PRs opened against Yaegi and Traefik Proxy. These included bug\nfixes, documentation improvements, new features, and capabilities. Below are two\nof the larger pull requests proposed, and while they’re both incomplete, we want\nto thank the authors for their contribution and hard work.\n\nExponential Backoff for Retry Middleware\nhttps://github.com/traefik/traefik/pull/7460\n\nThe author of this PR initially tried to implement a DynamoDB cache plugin, but\nhe encountered a limitation with the AWS SDK and Yaegi. Instead of giving up, he\njumped right into an open issue and started working with the open source\nengineers at Traefik to develop a solution.\n\nFluentD Log Hook\nhttps://github.com/bearstech/traefik/pull/1\n\nThis work is incomplete, but it seems to be ninety-percent there. This feature,\nwhen merged, would allow operators of Traefik to directly connect access logs to\na log exporter, rather than having to use a log scraping implementation. We’re\nlooking forward to seeing this feature finished up and opened as a PR.\n\nAnd ... It's A Wrap\n\n\nWe couldn’t be more excited to see the contributions and collaboration at our\nfirst Traefik Hackaethon. We’ll be doing this again next year and have already\nstarted planning for the spring. In the meantime, our team would love to hear\nfrom you on ideas for themes and bounties. We’ve opened a thread\n[https://community.traefik.io/t/traefik-hackaethon-2-0/8632] on our community\nforums to discuss what you’d like to see the next time.\n\nThank you to all the participants, and your contributions to the Traefik\necosystem are sincerely appreciated. We can’t wait to see what you’re going to\nbuild next.","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://containous.ghost.io/content/images/2020/11/Traefik-Hackaethon-Is-a-Wrap-1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Traefik Hackaethon Is a Wrap\" srcset=\"https://containous.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Traefik-Hackaethon-Is-a-Wrap-1.jpg 600w, https://containous.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Traefik-Hackaethon-Is-a-Wrap-1.jpg 1000w, https://containous.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Traefik-Hackaethon-Is-a-Wrap-1.jpg 1600w, https://containous.ghost.io/content/images/2020/11/Traefik-Hackaethon-Is-a-Wrap-1.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Traefik Labs inaugural <a href=\"https://traefik.io/blog/announcing-the-inaugural-traefik-hackaethon-2020-in-october/\">Traefik Hackaethon</a> is a wrap.

Read on to learn more about Bret,\nand his experience using Traefik and Docker.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nContainous: Hi Bret, could you introduce yourself to our community?\n\nBret: Hi, I’m Bret Fisher [https://twitter.com/BretFisher], a freelance DevOps\nand Docker consultant, focused on containers. I’m also a Docker Captain. My time\nis split between teaching, helping students, answering questions.\n\n> I’m driven by having fun while helping people.\nContainous: Could you explain what is a “Docker Captain”?\n\nBret: The “Docker Captain” program is from Docker Inc.. A Docker Captain is like\na Microsoft MVP. You cannot work for Docker Inc., should be an expert on docker\ntools and share your love for containers often. It also gives you access to\npre-release Docker software.\n\nContainous: How did you get into Traefik?\n\nBret: Because of Docker Swarm mode. Even though Kubernetes has become the most\npopular orchestrator, Docker Swarm still solves a lot of problems for many team.\nI was searching for an easy “Ingress” for Docker Swarm and Traefik was\nrecommended by a fellow Docker Captain.\n\n> I liked Traefik because of the Let’s Encrypt support out-of-the box and because\n“It just works”.\nContainous: Where do you use Traefik?\n\nBret: I’m using it on my own website at https://www.bretfisher.com/\n[https://www.bretfisher.com/]. This website runs on Docker Swarm with Traefik. I\nalso recommended Traefik to my customers, and in my talks and workshops. A lot\nof my 120,000 students have ended up using Traefik.\n\nContainous: Let’s talk a bit about container security. Are you running Traefik\nas the user “root”?\n\nBret: Is it the default ? (Laugh). I’m using the official Docker image so I\nguess “yes,” if it is the default user in that container Image.\n\nContainous: Do you see any compensation measure for this?\n\nBret: First of all, I have a list of general container security activities\n[https://github.com/BretFisher/ama/issues/17] that I follow and recommend others\ncheck out. It follows an order of “easiest steps with biggest benefits first” so\nyou don’t spend time on hard security changes that have little overall\nimprovement in your security posture. In addition, consider running Traefik’s\ncontainer in “read-only” mode\n[https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#mount-volume--v---read-only]\n. This mode forbids any writing on the filesystem (unless you explicitly define\na volume on an explicit path.). This first step avoids some (but not all!)\ncommon tasks as installing packages or downloading scripts in case of a bad\nactor gaining file system control in the container. Also, you could enable the\nfeature “user namespaces” in the Docker Engine config, to map the root user of\ncontainers to an unprivileged user of the host machines, which I’m a big fan of.\n\nRunning a Traefik container as a non privileged user to avoid being “root” might\ncreate two challenges:\n\n * Listening on ports below 1024: the range of ports [0–1024] are privileged and\n   thus require special capabilities. Either you can bind to port > 1024, or\n   ensure you are able to grant the Linux Capability CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE to\n   Traefik.\n * Docker socket membership: the socket file in /var/run/docker.sock is owned by\n   the root user, and a group named docker. The unprivileged user of Traefik\n   must be part of the group docker to allow access to the Docker API.\n\nContainous: Speaking about the Docker socket, do you run Traefik on Swarm\nManager Nodes?\n\nBret: It’s not mandatory. The point is — you can always forward the Docker\nsocket through TCP instead of using a bind-mount of /var/run/docker.sock. If you\nforward the socket in TCP inside and encrypted Docker network, then it removes\nthe “run on manager” constraint for Traefik.\n\nPlease note that overlay networks optional encryption is not performed by Docker\nSwarm itself, but rather the Linux kernel (IPSec), ensuring low-level security.\n\nAlso, it’s worthwhile to add an intermediate proxy to control requests through\nthe TCP-forwarded Docker socket, allowing read-only requests to the API.\n\nI have an example Swarm stack YAML of this setup here\n[https://github.com/BretFisher/dogvscat/blob/master/stack-proxy-global.yml].\n\nWith all of these, running Traefik on the host network of worker nodes, with an\noverlay network for backends is totally doable.\n\nContainous: Are you using the Traefik dashboard? If yes, what is your point of\nview on the security of this feature?\n\nTraefik v2 DashboardBret: Yes. I’m using the Traefik dashboard. I tend to configure the dashboard\nwith an IP whitelist, and not exposed on a public network or on the default\nport.\n\nPublicly exposing an admin dashboard keeps happening: just look at situations\nsuch as the Kubernetes dashboard hack at Tesla\n[https://redlock.io/blog/cryptojacking-tesla].\n\nI’m a huge fan of “secure by default” tools, and I wished more tools were like\nDocker and Swarm in this way. Over my 25 years in tech helping many companies\nwith infrastructure, I’ve learned that if authentication and encryption are\noptional, many won’t do it.\n\nContainous: Do you have a recommendation about using the “default” Docker image\nfor Traefik based on “scratch” versus the “Linux Alpine” image? Why?\n\nBret: As a rule of thumb, I would avoid “scratch” (or distroless\n[https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless]) images until everyone in\nthe pipeline is able to know how to operate it. Size is not important unless\nyou’re operating an IoT business. Compared to the pain and suffering of “no\ntools,” using “scratch” doesn’t feel a good trade-off unless you have\nspecialists on board. The image “scratch” feels like a “Golang developers”\nhabit, but when it comes to the Ops team it’s another topic: What about not\nbeing able to docker exec or kubectl cp?\n\nHopefully, the Kubernetes ephemeral containers\n[https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/ephemeral-containers/] \nfeature will help make this possible for more people.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, for container newcomers, they need to learn by doing. In\nthis case, I wouldn’t use “scratch” here to keep the learning curve smooth.\n\nI also share this opinion about the host OS. Too many people try to use a\n“Container OS” too early in their organisational learning. It tends to add lots\nof risk without a big productivity boost. Stick with your traditional Linux\ndistribution until you’ve had significant production Docker usage.\n\nContainous: What is your recommendation for the load balancer part outside\nSwarm? To create an external load balancer pointing to nodes, using DNS, or\nsomething else? And, why?\n\nBret: The expected answer is “It’s complicated” or ”It depends” (laugh).\n\nMost companies already have their own solution for load balancing, including\ncloud load balancers and datacenter hardware load balancers. Then they point\ntheir load balancer to the Docker Swarm nodes and rely on Traefik for providing\nthe application layer load balancing inside the cluster. Pro Tip: Don’t point\nLB’s to all your Swarm nodes. Pick 2–3 worker nodes and make those the ingress\npoints, which will make troubleshooting and load easier to manage.\n\nHowever, about the “DNS round robin” solution, I refer to it as the “poor\nperson’s LB”, because of the small amount of time required to make it work. It’s\nsimple when the client is a web browser, but as you cannot control the “client”,\nthat’s where the limit is drawn (DNS caching, no retry patterns, etc.). Another\nlimit: as soon as showing HTTP 503 errors is an issue, there is no “retry\npattern” expected from web browsers (even though Traefik could do that). It’s\nthe recommended solution in my course “Solo DevOps” where the context is “only\none person in charge of the DevOps tasks, with so many tools involved”. Once you\nhave an external load balancer solution, it’s likely best to stick with that in\nall but the smallest projects.\n\nAs a general rule, ask yourselves: “During the time it goes down, do you lose\nmoney? If yes, then go for load balancing with health checks.”\n\n> Try both solutions for education purposes. It’s really valuable.\nContainous: Have you tried the new Traefik v2.0\n[/blog/traefik-2-0-6531ec5196c2/]?\n\nBret: Not yet, but it made quite some noise in the Docker Captain channel. It\nmight be the fact that they are “Golang people,” but it looks neat.\n\nContainous: Is there something you would like to tell the Traefik community?\n\nBret: Traefik is a really nice tool because everything is configurable from the\ncommand line when starting in a container (using CMD). TOML files are fine, but\nit’s great to have the option to skip that and configure it dynamically at\nruntime.\n\nAlso, everything is streamlined for the container world, with a linear learning\ncurve: configuration management is not mandatory even for rich features such as\nLet’s Encrypt.\n\nContainous: Thanks a lot for these insights Bret!

As an open\nsource company, we want our community’s legitimacy to be transparent, and we\nwant to help the open source community do the same for other projects.\n\nIn the past, there have been many occurrences of people abusing the GitHub API:\n\n * Gaining followers quickly [https://github.com/andrewsyc/github-follow-bot] by\n   making their account follow thousands of other people, hoping for them to\n   follow back\n * Faking their GitHub contributions to make themselves look like outstanding\n   open source developers\n * Automatically creating bot accounts\n   [https://redmonk.com/jgovernor/2017/10/24/so-where-all-the-github-link-farms-at-astro-turfing-in-software-development/] \n   to star repositories and virtually increase their popularity (Examples: here\n   [https://github.com/ffujiawei/auto-stars/blob/master/auto_stars.py] and here\n   [https://www.zdnet.com/article/researchers-uncover-ring-of-github-accounts-promoting-300-backdoored-apps/] \n   among others)\n\nstarbot is an automated bot account creator which starred repositories (has been\ntaken down)GitHub has taken down several of the repositories responsible for\nsuch abuses, but not all of them.

It’s also a very well known phenomenon that many\nstartups tend to use technologies based on how many stars they have, as it’s\nusually a good indicator of the size of the community behind a project.\n\nThat’s why we decided to start a side-project, called Astronomer\n[https://github.com/Ullaakut/astronomer], as a reference to analyzing GitHub\nstars and fighting against astro-turfing\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing].\n\nIt’s an open source tool which leverages the GitHub API to scan GitHub\nstargazers and compute an overall trust level for the repository, based on\nmultiple statistics found within the stargazers.

Because, even though we often\ntalk to the community In Real Life, we were unfamiliar with the \nwe-don’t-see-you-while-we-talk format of the online Meetup. And, here is another\nanswer to a question you didn’t ask, but, again, we’ll answer — Yes, we enjoyed\nthis moment with you, and would do it again.\n\nChances are you’re here for the video only, and not the story behind the movie,\nso let’s proceed!\n\nThe slides are available here\n[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vS3_WzHd4vOA7pqzFL1YTIom-_t9OrvmKwV3_GuBvqQeWV1jfxFml18M2miCpinL2PP-od5kv1NaN-m/pub?start=false&loop=true&delayms=3000]\n, and code for the demos is available on Github\n[https://github.com/containous/slides/tree/online-meetup-v2/demo/v2-tcp].“Q&A\nTime (Excerpts)”\nAbout TCP (and UDP)\n> Can the TCP entry point use Let’s Encrypt [https://letsencrypt.org/]? Could you\nhave HTTP and TCP endpoints using the same hostname? Is it ready for UDP?\nWe loved bringing TCP support to Traefik [/traefik/], and we wanted it to come\nalong with features our users would expect — one of them being Let’s Encrypt\nsupport (so yes, TCP in Traefik supports Let’s Encrypt for automatic\ncertificates, like with HTTP).\n\nWe also wanted Traefik to be able to route TCP and HTTP requests\n[/blog/the-journey-to-traefik-enterprise-edition-https-for-everyone-90a36b33600/] \non the same entry points, which was quite a challenge. This was made possible\nwith a simple trick — the use of the SNI in TLS connections. But this comes with\na limitation: you won’t be able to route both HTTP and TCP requests on the same \nhost+port combination. If for the same domain you’d like to route TCP and HTTP\nrequests, we encourage you to use two different ports.\n\nTCP was made possible by the re-architectured core. This new core also enables\nus to bring UDP support, and even if it is not written yet, it’s a matter of\nweeks before it’s out.\n\nAbout Middleware\n> Do middleware always applied from left to right? Can a service be a middleware\nCan custom middlewares be created? Can we use middlewares on TCP endpoints? Can\nwe use middleware on the response? Is middleware for ingress only?\nSo middleware [https://docs.traefik.io/middlewares/overview/] is a concept we\nintroduced to enable you to fine-tune the life cycle of the requests. They will\noften act before the request is forwarded to the services\n[https://docs.traefik.io/routing/services/], and can also operate on the\nresponse you get from the services (like the headers\n[https://docs.traefik.io/middlewares/headers/] middleware does). Pieces of\nmiddleware are applied from left to right on the request, and from right to left\non the response. Since you define the order, and since you can define as many \nchains [https://docs.traefik.io/middlewares/chain/] or attach as many pieces of\nmiddleware to your routers [https://docs.traefik.io/routing/routers/] as you\nwant, you have total control. There are currently no available middleware for\nTCP routers, but it’s something we’re looking into (if you have ideas, let us\nknow!). And regarding custom middleware, even though we know our user base is\nlooking for it, it won’t fit in the 2.0 scope (which is already big!).\n\nAbout KV Stores & Distributed Let’s Encrypt\n> Current (pre-2.0) traefik can store ACME certificates in a file or a KV store.\nThe latter helps with running a cluster of traefik, but the storage is\nrestricted to 512kb of certificate information when using Consul. Will this\nimprove? (storing in a key per certificate instead of a single key for all, for\nexample)\nWhile working on 2.0, we decided it was time to rework this part. Sticking with\nthe Unix Philosophy, “Make each program do one thing well,” Traefik is getting\nback to be a good old single-instance pure data plane. At the same time,\nclustering has been redesigned from scratch using a production-proven rock-solid\nraft-based implementation, shipped with Traefik Enterprise Edition (see how\n[/blog/the-journey-to-traefik-enterprise-edition-https-for-everyone-90a36b33600/]\n). Distributed features (like Let’s Encrypt) can now rely on this advanced\ncluster technology for these use cases. But hey! You can still use multiple\nTraefik instances with your favorite KV store, we only removed the unstable and\nexperimental part :)\n\nAbout the Final Release\n> When will the final 2.0 be available?\nShort answer: When it’s ready!\n\nReal answer: We wish we could tell. Even though we can estimate how much time we\nwill need to develop the missing features\n[https://github.com/containous/traefik/projects/3], we don’t know fore sure how\nmuch feedback you’ll provide, or how many features contributors will be tackling\n(and, as Damien pointed out — we’re ready to help any [new/returning/existing]\ncontributors eager to participate in the project!). Anyways, all we can say is,\n“stay tuned for updates!”\n\nAbout Other Things…\nYou’ll find other (more specific) questions (and answers) here\n[https://gist.github.com/dduportal/13874113cf5fa1d0901655e3367c31e5]!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDon’t Miss the Next Meet-Ups!\nIf you enjoyed the meet-up and would like to be notified of upcoming online\nevents and receive the videos from our previous sessions, sign up here\n[http://eepurl.com/gfN5Aj]!","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p class=\"post-sub-title\">Now Available on YouTube!</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"https://containous.ghost.io/content/images/2019/12/image-5.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>What a week, everyone!
