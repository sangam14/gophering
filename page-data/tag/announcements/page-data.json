These packages are\nresponsible for applying transformations, validations, redirections, omissions,\nand additions to requests before passing them on, either to another middleware\npackage or to their final destination.\n\nOver the past several years, Traefik has received dozens of ideas and concepts\nfor middlewares through feature and pull requests. Some of these proposals\nsuggested additional functionality for existing middlewares. Others introduced\nbespoke middleware for specific use cases.\n\nWhen these proposals weren't aligned to the vision of the Traefik community they\nlanguished on the Traefik issue board. There they lay dormant, waiting for the\nday that users could easily build custom plugins for Traefik\n[https://traefik.io/blog/unleash-custom-networking-logic-with-traefik-plugins/].\nThat day is here, and this post will provide an outline for those interested in\nbuilding and extending the capabilities of Traefik with their own middlewares.\n\nThe team at Traefik Labs will be hosting a Hackathon next week, and plugins are\na significant theme. Awards, bounties, and prizes are available for those who\nparticipate. You can learn more and sign up here\n[https://info.traefik.io/traefik-hackaethon-2020]. In the meantime, here are\nsome great ideas for middleware plugins that drew from issues on the Traefik\nrepository.\n\nOct 20-22nd: Traefik's Inaugeral Hackaethon - Sign Up Today\n[https://traefik.io/blog/announcing-the-inaugural-traefik-hackaethon-2020-in-october/]\nPopular Middleware Ideas\nForward-Auth with Selective Headers\nhttps://github.com/containous/traefik/issues/6493\n\nThe forward auth middleware included with Traefik will forward all headers\nincluded in the original request. But in some cases, users may want to exclude\nspecific headers from the forwarded request. Instead, they would rather the\nheaders are forwarded only in the response from the auth server.\n\nQuery Parameter Modification\nhttps://github.com/containous/traefik/issues/6276\n\nIn some cases, operators may want to modify the request's query keys or convert\nquery parameters into a path. In either scenario, this can be useful for several\nuse cases. But along with the usefulness comes additional complexity in test\nscenarios and implementations. These constraints make it a prime candidate for\nadoption as a custom plugin.\n\nHeader Transformation\nhttps://github.com/traefik/traefik/issues/6047\n\nThe scope of the Header middleware's current implementation is limited to adding\nor removing headers (which is only available through a file type provider).\nUsers may want to perform more complex operations on headers, such as renaming a\nkey or transforming a value. These operations could be achievable through regex\nor simple pattern matching.\n\nEnhanced Retry and Backoff\nhttps://github.com/traefik/traefik/issues/5282\nhttps://github.com/traefik/traefik/issues/4578\n\nCases exist where operators may want to retry on certain conditions, such as a\n5xx error or connection refused. Without exponential backoff or retries based on\nresponse code, retrying on those parameters isn't feasible. For additional\ninspiration, Spring Cloud Gateway\n[https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-gateway/reference/html/#the-retry-gatewayfilter-factory] \nhas a design that handles both cases.\n\nCustom Response Code Overrides\nhttps://github.com/traefik/traefik/issues/2039\n\nWhen users receive an error message, this can sometimes indicate a particular\nresource's presence or absence. Also, when it’s impossible to modify the\nclient’s behavior this can be worked-around by intercepting an erroneous\nresponse and handling it by return a different error response or page. This\nplugin would effectively intercept the service's error response and map an\nalternative response, such as a 200 response instead of a 501 response, or a 404\nrather than a 401 or 403.\n\nCDN AllowList\nhttps://github.com/traefik/traefik/issues/4145\n\nCDNs publish their IP addresses from consumable public resources. When hosting a\nparticular resource that should only be accessible from the CDN (for\ncache-fronting reasons), it’s logical that users want to block any request that\ndoes not originate from an IP address published on that list.\n\nBasicAuth Overrides\nhttps://github.com/traefik/traefik/issues/4429\n\nIn some instances, users have asked to allow Basic Auth to allow programmatic\noverrides by either a custom header or originating from a specific IP address\n(or set of IP addresses). Both options could be implemented into a custom\nauthentication plugin, with support for IP ranges as well.\n\nRate Limiting Enhancements\nhttps://github.com/traefik/traefik/issues/4548\nhttps://github.com/traefik/traefik/issues/6042\n\nUsers have requested the ability to incorporate multiple rate limiting\nstrategies concurrently; for example, combining client.ip and request.host on a\nsingle frontend. Users have also asked to store rate limiting data external to\nTraefik, enabling more extended duration limits to survive restarts and share\nlimits across multiple instances. These would likely be two separate plugins as\nthey’re two distinctly different features.\n\nResponse Header Redirect\nhttps://github.com/traefik/traefik/issues/5154\n\nThere is a request to allow a service to command Traefik to internally redirect\nto another service provider through a custom header. This capability could be\nuseful when the client doesn't require exposure to an internal redirect's\ndetails.\n\nBrotli Compression\nhttps://github.com/traefik/traefik/issues/4202\n\nThis plugin has already been implemented as a PR to Traefik. However, the\nlicensing model on one of the dependencies prevented it from being merged as-is.\nThis compression middleware would be relatively straightforward to implement as\na plugin.\n\nAdditional Plugin Ideas\nThere are other plugin ideas out there. We don't want to limit your creativity,\neither, so plugin bounties are not limited to this list. As long as the plugin\nisn't trivial and is deemed functionality by the judges, it is eligible for the\nprize. Here are a few more issues if you're not interested in the ideas listed\nabove.\n\n * HTTP Cache Backends - https://github.com/traefik/traefik/issues/878\n * Containers on Demand - https://github.com/traefik/traefik/issues/6993\n * Open Policy Agent - https://github.com/traefik/traefik/issues/4894\n\nWrapping Up\nSign up for the Hackaethon today\n[https://traefik.io/blog/announcing-the-inaugural-traefik-hackaethon-2020-in-october/] \nand receive a t-shirt and sticker for participating!In addition to the plugin\nideas curated above, we are working on putting together a list of issues that\ncontributors can work on if they're not interested in building a plugin. We want\nto ensure that anyone can participate in the Hackaethon, including features,\nbugs, and documentation tasks that anyone can pick up and start working on.\n\nFor those interested in building custom plugins, we have a meetup scheduled next\nweek before the Hackaethon to demonstrate how easy they are to develop. You can \nsign up for the plugin meetup\n[https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_9LpcglyRSJy89iEYN0ZsbQ] and receive\nthe link today. We’re looking forward to seeing everyone at the meetup and the\nHackaethon next week and look forward to seeing what you build.","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://containous.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/Traefik-Hackaethon-2020---Middleware-Plugins-Brain-Dump.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Traefik Hackaethon 2020: Middleware Plugins Brain Dump\" srcset=\"https://containous.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Traefik-Hackaethon-2020---Middleware-Plugins-Brain-Dump.jpg 600w, https://containous.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Traefik-Hackaethon-2020---Middleware-Plugins-Brain-Dump.jpg 1000w, https://containous.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/Traefik-Hackaethon-2020---Middleware-Plugins-Brain-Dump.jpg 1600w, https://containous.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/Traefik-Hackaethon-2020---Middleware-Plugins-Brain-Dump.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>One of the most powerful features of the Traefik software-based load balancer is its support for <a href=\"https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/middlewares/overview/\">middlewares</a>.

As we cross\nyet another major download milestone with Traefik, we continue to execute and\ndeliver on our mission of simplifying cloud-native networking by launching a new\nproduct, our first cloud offering. And in recognition of the impact that Traefik\nhas made to enterprise organizations all around the world, we are very proud to\nannounce a refreshed brand and new company name that pays homage to our\nopen-source roots.\n\nFrom Humble Beginnings to Great Success\nIt’s hard to believe, but it was five years ago, in 2015, when I wrote the very\nfirst lines of code for Traefik. I started developing Traefik because of a basic\nneed for an application proxy that was highly automated, open-source, and\ndesigned from the ground up for DevOps organizations and microservices\nplatforms. Following the initial public announcement, a strong community of\npassionate people quickly gathered around the project. Some of these people\neventually contributed code. Some contributed ideas. Countless more used the\nsoftware and provided feedback. At that time, I could never have imagined that\nthis idea would become a huge success.\n\nFast forward to today, Traefik just crossed the 2 billion downloads mark, with\n30,000+ GitHub stars, more than 500 active contributors from all around the\nglobe, and users from the world’s largest companies like Conde Nast, eBay, and\nMailchimp. As a result, Traefik is now one of the most popular open-source\nprojects in the world. Unlike other successful open-source projects, Traefik\ndidn’t emerge from a large establishment like Google, Microsoft or Facebook. It\nwas willed into existence, built by a dedicated community of people who shared a\ncommon need. The success of Traefik is a testament to every single person who\njoined us on this journey.\n\nA Tribute to our Origins\nIn recognition of Traefik’s momentum and its importance to our mission, we felt\nit was an appropriate and opportune time to pay tribute to our “heritage”. Thus,\nwe are officially changing our company name to Traefik Labs and tweaking our\nproduct names to further support the Traefik brand. The product lineup will now\ninclude: Traefik Proxy (the original Traefik), Traefik Enterprise and Traefik\nMesh (formerly Maesh).\n\nYet despite the name change, our organization’s mission remains unchanged. In\nfact, it serves as an opportunity for us to better align our products with the\nbroader cloud-native networking challenges we continue to see plaguing\nenterprises. Traefik is, and will continue to be, the core engine of our product\nstack, even as the company builds new solutions that deliver additional\nfunctionality beyond Traefik. And as we introduce new products and services\ngoing forward, our new company name will better reflect the continued role of\nopen source around a strong community as a foundational pillar in driving\ninnovation.\n\nThe (Cloud-Native Networking) Struggle is Real\nAs companies press forward with their cloud-native strategies, many are facing\nthe harsh realization of just how different it is to run and operate\ncontainerized applications and microservices at scale. Gone are the days where\nyou could deploy and manage applications one-by-one via a manual, almost\nartisanal, process. Simply put, automation is no longer a “nice to have”, but a\nrequirement in order to realize the promised benefits of faster software\nreleases, better reliability, simpler management, and more.\n\nTo address this need, an entire ecosystem of technologies, vendors, and\ncommunities have emerged in recent years to drive the DevOps movement and\nculture, where huge progress has been made in automating compute and storage\ninfrastructure within cloud-native environments. Unfortunately, the same can’t\nbe said for networking, where silos of technologies make integration and\nautomation extremely difficult.\n\nIn my (pre-pandemic) travels around the world, countless enterprises articulated\nthis same networking challenge when deploying applications as microservices in\nproduction. They are investing in container orchestration platforms (on-premises\nand in the public cloud), and investing in DevOps tools. But they are also\ndesperately looking for that same fundamental transformation in networking,\nwhich is becoming increasingly urgent as they accelerate their digital\ntransformation plans due to the pandemic.\n\nBuilding the Traefik Cloud-Native Networking ‘Stack’\nWith that challenge in mind, our strategy at Traefik Labs is clear: we are\ncreating the simplest, most comprehensive cloud-native stack to help enterprises\nmanage their entire network across data centers, on-premises servers and public\nclouds all the way to the edge. We have already revolutionized the application\nnetworking layer with Traefik Proxy, Enterprise and Mesh, bringing open-source\nbased, cloud-native and simple solutions to DevOps organizations. We are now\nreusing this successful pattern to expand to the rest of the networking stack. \n\nWe’re taking a step in this direction today with the official release of Traefik\nPilot. Traefik Pilot is a platform that provides monitoring and control of your\nTraefik Proxy instances through a unified dashboard, serving as the control\ncenter for the entire network stack. It also introduces a new hub for hosting\nuser-created plug-ins built on the open-source Yaegi\n[https://traefik.io/blog/announcing-yaegi-263a1e2d070a/] project we’ve been\nnurturing in the recent years.\n\nThe Traefik Cloud-Native Networking ‘Stack’As a result, Traefik Pilot [https://pilot.traefik.io/] is now a cornerstone\npiece within the Traefik ‘Stack’. By leveraging and integrating our existing\nproducts, Traefik ‘Stack’ represents the single, integrated, networking solution\nenterprises need for cloud-native applications and microservices. As we look\ntoward the future, the Traefik ‘Stack’ will soon encompass edge services like\nWeb Application Firewall, multi-region load balancing and much more, to meet the\nevolving needs of application and operations teams alike.\n\nLastly, it should go without saying, that the core of this new ‘Stack’ will\nforever be open-source. The cloud-native revolution was built on open-source\ntechnologies and strong communities. We will continue to take the same simple,\nopen-source, cloud-native approach we used in building Traefik and apply it to\neverything we do. This is our commitment to our customers and our community,\ntogether we will build the future of cloud-native networking.\n\nWe’ll have a lot more to say about these projects in the upcoming weeks and\nmonths, so watch this space for more details. In the meantime, I want to again\nextend our thanks to everyone who has joined us in our Traefik journey. As\nalways, we’re eager to hear from you and we look forward to shaping the future\nof cloud-native networking together!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://containous.ghost.io/content/images/2020/09/Traefik-Labs---Incubating-the-Future-of-Cloud-Native-Networking.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Traefik Labs: Incubating the Future of Cloud Native Networking\" srcset=\"https://containous.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Traefik-Labs---Incubating-the-Future-of-Cloud-Native-Networking.jpg 600w, https://containous.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/Traefik-Labs---Incubating-the-Future-of-Cloud-Native-Networking.jpg 1000w, https://containous.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/Traefik-Labs---Incubating-the-Future-of-Cloud-Native-Networking.jpg 1600w, https://containous.ghost.io/content/images/2020/09/Traefik-Labs---Incubating-the-Future-of-Cloud-Native-Networking.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Today is a big day for Containous and the entire Traefik community.

Maesh\nallows for visibility and management of the traffic that flows inside your\nKubernetes cluster, which is just as important as the ingress and egress\ntraffic.\n\nBuilt on top of Traefik, Maesh is a simple, yet full-featured service mesh. It\nis container-native and fits as your de-facto service mesh in your Kubernetes\ncluster. It supports the latest Service Mesh Interface specification (SMI\n[https://smi-spec.io/]) that facilitates integration with pre-existing\nsolutions. Moreover, Maesh is opt-in by default, which means that your existing\nservices are unaffected until you decide to add them to the mesh.\n\nNon-Invasive Service Mesh\nMaesh does not use any sidecar container but handles routing through proxy\nendpoints running on each node. The mesh controller runs in a dedicated pod and\nhandles all the configuration parsing and deployment to the proxy nodes. Maesh\nsupports multiple configuration options: annotations on user service objects,\nand SMI objects. Not using sidecars means that Maesh does not modify your\nKubernetes objects, and does not modify your traffic without your knowledge.\nUsing the Maesh endpoints is all that is required.\n\nMaesh ArchitectureRelies on Kubernetes DNS\nMaesh leverages the CoreDNS platform installed by default in Kubernetes. It\nallows users to use the Maesh endpoints (instead of the standard Kubernetes\nservice endpoints) to benefit from its feature set — no sidecars! Maesh\nendpoints run side-by-side with user services: you choose whether you use them\nor not (opt-in). This gives more confidence, since users know that they are able\nto test, and revert back to the user services: they should be happy with the\nresult.\n\nAlso, the updates to CoreDNS made during the installation of Maesh is minimal\nand non-invasive, and is easily removable.\n\nMultiple Network Layers\nMaesh can run in both TCP and HTTP mode\n\n * In HTTP mode, Maesh leverages Traefik’s feature set to enable rich routing on\n   virtual-host, path, headers, cookies.\n * Using TCP mode allows a seamless and easy integration with SNI routing\n   support.\n\nUse both modes at the same time within the same cluster, and is configurable via\nannotations on services.\n\nBuilt on Top of Traefik\nMaesh builds on top of Traefik [/traefik/], the leading reverse proxy for\nrouting, and provides every feature users would expect: OpenTracing, load\nbalancing for HTTP, gRPC, WebSocket, TCP, rich routing rules, retries and\nfail-overs, not to mention access controls, rate limits, and circuit breakers.\n\nEasy to Install; Easy to Use\nInstalling Maesh to your cluster is easy: install the Helm chart, as there are\nno helper applications, no CRDs to install, and no new vocabulary for users to\nlearn. If users understand how pods and services work, then Maesh will be easy\nto understand and use.\n\nLet’s get started by installing Maesh using the following commands:\n\nhelm repo add maesh https://containous.github.io/maesh/charts\nhelm repo update\nhelm install --name=maesh --namespace=maesh maesh/maesh\n\nMaesh is now ready to use in your cluster, and you’re one annotation away from\nusing it on any running application:\n\nkubectl annotate service \\\n    web-application maesh.containo.us/traffic-type=http\n\nIs your application using a TCP communication protocol (which is not HTTP)? It\nis also supported:\n\nkubectl annotate service mongo-database \\\n    maesh.containo.us/traffic-type=tcp\n\nThat’s how easy it is to install and use Maesh!\n\nWhat’s Next\nBecause Maesh is open source, we would love the community’s input as to which\nfeatures are important to you, so that we can prioritise the top requests.\n\nWe welcome community contributions and love when they are faster than us to\nprovide additional features! Pull requests are the best way to support the\nproduct and make it your own.\n\nUseful links\n * Website [/maesh/]\n * Documentation [https://docs.mae.sh/]\n * Github [https://github.com/containous/maesh]\n * Community Forum [https://community.containo.us/c/maesh]","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://containous.ghost.io/content/images/2019/11/image-110.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>We are proud to introduce <a href=\"https://containous.ghost.io/maesh/\">Maesh</a>, Containous’ new service mesh designed from the ground up to be straightforward, easy to install and easy to use.

Moreover, Maesh is opt-in by default, which means that your existing services are unaffected until you decide to add them to the mesh.</p><h2 id=\"non-invasive-service-mesh\">Non-Invasive Service Mesh</h2><p>Maesh does not use any sidecar container but handles routing through proxy endpoints running on each node. The mesh controller runs in a dedicated pod and handles all the configuration parsing and deployment to the proxy nodes. Maesh supports multiple configuration options: annotations on user service objects, and SMI objects. Not using sidecars means that Maesh does not modify your Kubernetes objects, and does not modify your traffic without your knowledge. Using the Maesh endpoints is all that is required.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://containous.ghost.io/content/images/2019/11/image-10.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Maesh Architecture</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"relies-on-kubernetes-dns\">Relies on Kubernetes DNS</h2><p>Maesh leverages the CoreDNS platform installed by default in Kubernetes. It allows users to use the Maesh endpoints (instead of the standard Kubernetes service endpoints) to benefit from its feature set — no sidecars! Maesh endpoints run side-by-side with user services: you choose whether you use them or not (opt-in). This gives more confidence, since users know that they are able to test, and revert back to the user services: they should be happy with the result.</p><p>Also, the updates to CoreDNS made during the installation of Maesh is minimal and non-invasive, and is easily removable.</p><h2 id=\"multiple-network-layers\">Multiple Network Layers</h2><p>Maesh can run in both TCP and HTTP mode</p><ul><li>In HTTP mode, Maesh leverages Traefik’s feature set to enable rich routing on virtual-host, path, headers, cookies.</li><li>Using TCP mode allows a seamless and easy integration with SNI routing support.</li></ul><p>Use both modes at the same time within the same cluster, and is configurable via annotations on services.</p><h2 id=\"built-on-top-of-traefik\">Built on Top of Traefik</h2><p>Maesh builds on top of <a href=\"https://containous.ghost.io/traefik/\">Traefik</a>, the leading reverse proxy for routing, and provides every feature users would expect: OpenTracing, load balancing for HTTP, gRPC, WebSocket, TCP, rich routing rules, retries and fail-overs, not to mention access controls, rate limits, and circuit breakers.</p><h2 id=\"easy-to-install-easy-to-use\">Easy to Install; Easy to Use</h2><p>Installing Maesh to your cluster is easy: install the Helm chart, as there are no helper applications, no CRDs to install, and no new vocabulary for users to learn. If users understand how pods and services work, then Maesh will be easy to understand and use.</p><p>Let’s get started by installing Maesh using the following commands:</p><pre><code class=\"language-shell\">helm repo add maesh https://containous.github.io/maesh/charts\nhelm repo update\nhelm install --name=maesh --namespace=maesh maesh/maesh</code></pre><p>Maesh is now ready to use in your cluster, and you’re one annotation away from using it on any running application:</p><pre><code class=\"language-shell\">kubectl annotate service \\\n    web-application maesh.containo.us/traffic-type=http</code></pre><p>Is your application using a TCP communication protocol (which is not HTTP)? It is also supported:</p><pre><code class=\"language-shell\">kubectl annotate service mongo-database \\\n    maesh.containo.us/traffic-type=tcp</code></pre><p>That’s how easy it is to install and use Maesh!</p><h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s Next</h2><p>Because Maesh is open source, we would love the community’s input as to which features are important to you, so that we can prioritise the top requests.</p><p>We welcome community contributions and love when they are faster than us to provide additional features! Pull requests are the best way to support the product and make it your own.</p><h2 id=\"useful-links\">Useful links</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://containous.ghost.io/maesh/\">Website</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.mae.sh/\">Documentation</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/containous/maesh\" rel=\"noopener\">Github</a></li><li><a href=\"https://community.containo.us/c/maesh\" rel=\"noopener\">Community Forum</a></li></ul>","url":"https://containous.ghost.io/blog/announcing-maesh-a-lightweight-and-simpler-service-mesh-made-by-the-traefik-team-cb866edc6f29/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"3100e2c8-491b-40da-a686-6e372e6d1979","codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"5dd54eefec5ed30038788910","reading_time":3}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5dd5560dec5ed300387889f5","title":"Announcing Yaegi","slug":"announcing-yaegi-263a1e2d070a","featured":false,"feature_image":"https://containous.ghost.io/content/images/2019/11/yaegi.png","featureImageSharp":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"src":"/static/9c70aec44ba59d7e82b64c010a65a5f2/f3583/yaegi.png","srcSet":"/static/9c70aec44ba59d7e82b64c010a65a5f2/630fb/yaegi.png 300w,\n/static/9c70aec44ba59d7e82b64c010a65a5f2/2a4de/yaegi.png 600w,\n/static/9c70aec44ba59d7e82b64c010a65a5f2/f3583/yaegi.png 1200w,\n/static/9c70aec44ba59d7e82b64c010a65a5f2/bbee5/yaegi.png 1800w,\n/static/9c70aec44ba59d7e82b64c010a65a5f2/ed396/yaegi.png 2000w","sizes":"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"}}},"excerpt":"Yaegi, Yet Another Go Interpreter, is an open source project to bring executableGo scripts, embedded plugins on top of the Go runtime...","custom_excerpt":"Yaegi, Yet Another Go Interpreter, is an open source project to bring executableGo scripts, embedded plugins on top of the Go runtime...","visibility":"public","created_at_pretty":"20 November, 2019","published_at_pretty":"July 24, 2019","updated_at_pretty":"21 May, 2020","created_at":"2019-11-20T15:04:45.000+00:00","published_at":"2019-07-24T15:04:00.000+00:00","updated_at":"2020-05-21T23:54:41.000+00:00","meta_title":"Announcing Yaegi, Yet Another Go Interpreter","meta_description":"Yaegi is an open source project developed to bring executable Go scripts, embedded plugins, interactive shells, and instant prototyping","og_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"authors":[{"name":"Marc Vertes","slug":"marc","bio":null,"profile_image":"https://containous.ghost.io/content/images/2019/11/mv2.png","twitter":"@MarcVertes","facebook":null,"website":null}],"primary_author":{"name":"Marc Vertes","slug":"marc","bio":null,"profile_image":"https://containous.ghost.io/content/images/2019/11/mv2.png","twitter":"@MarcVertes","facebook":null,"website":null},"primary_tag":{"name":"Blog","slug":"blog","description":null,"feature_image":null,"featureImageSharp":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"},"tags":[{"name":"Blog","slug":"blog","description":null,"feature_image":null,"featureImageSharp":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"},{"name":"Announcements","slug":"announcements","description":null,"feature_image":null,"featureImageSharp":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"}],"plaintext":"Yet Another Go Interpreter\n\nIn this post, we present Yaegi [https://github.com/containous/yaegi/], Yet\nAnother Go Interpreter, with the E standing for Elegant, Embedded, Easy, or\nwhatever you prefer.\n\nYaegi is an open source project developed by Containous, (the company behind \nTraefik [/traefik/] and TraefikEE [/traefikee/]), to bring executable Go\n[https://golang.org/] scripts, embedded plugins, interactive shells, and instant\nprototyping on top of the Go runtime. Yaegi project is hosted on GitHub\n[https://github.com/containous/yaegi].\n\nMotivation\nDespite being static and strongly typed, Go feels like a dynamic language. The\nstandard library even provides the Go parser used by the compiler and the\nreflection system to interact dynamically with the runtime. So why not just take\nthe last logical step and finally build a complete Go interpreter?\n\nProgramming languages for high level scripting and for low level implementation\nare usually different. This time, with Go, we have an opportunity to unify both.\nImagine all the C/C++/Java fast libraries for Python being written in Python\ninstead. That’s what Yaegi is for Go (or, the reverse). No burden due to syntax\nswitch, no need to rewrite or modify slow code to make it fast, and full access\nto goroutines, channels, type safety, etc. at script level.\n\nGoals and Priorities\n * Simplicity: New(), Eval() and Use() is the only API. No external dependencies\n   besides the standard Go library.\n * Standard: the interpreter supports 100% of the Go Specification\n   [https://golang.org/ref/spec].\n * Robustness: preserve type safety and runtime integrity: unsafe and syscall\n   packages are not used nor exposed by default. Security over performance.\n * Interoperability: scripts can “import” pre-compiled runtime packages, but\n   also compiled code can “import” script packages during execution. See usage\n   examples below for more details.\n\nUsing Yaegi\nAs a Command-Line Interpreter\nThe Yaegi executable can interpret Go files or run an interactive\nRead-Eval-Print-Loop:\n\n$ yaegi\n> 1 + 2\n3\n> import \"fmt\"\n> fmt.Println(\"Hello World\")\nHello World\n>\n\nYaegi works like go run (but faster). It also enables executable Go scripts\n(starting with #!). Yaegi provides a full Go environment with a complete\nstandard library in a single standalone executable.\n\nAs an Embedded Interpreter\nIn the following example, an interpreter is created with New() and then it\nevaluates Go code using Eval(). Nothing surprising here.\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"github.com/containous/yaegi/interp\"\n    \"github.com/containous/yaegi/stdlib\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    i := interp.New(interp.Options{})\n    i.Use(stdlib.Symbols)\n    i.Eval(`import \"fmt\"`)\n    i.Eval(`fmt.Println(\"hello\")`)\n}\n\nThis example demonstrates the ability to use executable pre-compiled symbols in\nthe interpreter. Thanks to the statement i.Use(stdlib.Symbols), the interpreted \nimport \"fmt\"will load the fmt package from the executable itself (wrapped in \nreflect.Values) instead of trying to parse source files.\n\nYaegi also provides the goexports command to build the binary wrapper of any\npackage from its source. This is the command we used to generate all stdlib\nwrappers provided by default.\n\nAs a Dynamic Extension Framework\nThe program is compiled ahead of time, except for the function bar() that is\ninterpreted from a script. The import process involves the following steps:\n\n 1. use of i.Eval(src) to internally compile the script package in the context\n    of the interpreter\n 2. use of v,_ := i.Eval(\"foo.Bar\") to get the symbol that we want to use as a \n    reflect.Value (please forgive me for the missing error handling)\n 3. application of Interface()method and type assertion to convert the \n    reflect.Value into a usable Go typed function\n\npackage main\n\nimport \"github.com/containous/yaegi/interp\"\n\nconst src = `package foo\nfunc Bar(s string) string { return s + \"-Foo\" }`\n\nfunc main() {\n    i := interp.New(interp.Options{})\n    i.Eval(src)\n    v, _ := i.Eval(\"foo.Bar\")\n    bar := v.Interface().(func(string) string)\n    \n    r := bar(\"Kung\")\n    println(r)\n    // Output:\n    // Kung-Foo\n}\n\nWhat about Performance?\nInterpreters are quite common in domains like gaming or science. But could Yaegi\nalso be usable as a plugin engine in the context of distributed systems?\n\nTo answer that, we have benchmarked the use of gziphandler\n[https://github.com/nytimes/gziphandler], a middleware for compressing HTTP\nresponses. Gziphandler provides interface methods implementing compression for\nthe HTTP server in the standard library. This demonstrates an interpreted\ndynamic processing inserted into a statically compiled server program, with a\ndirect impact on latency and throughput.\n\nIn one case, gziphandler is compiled and used directly as a callback passed to \nhttp.Handle(). In the other, the interpreted version of gziphandler is used.\n\nBenchmark      old ns/op   new ns/op    delta\nCompress-8     769088      817632       +6.31%\n\nWe measured less than 10% of overhead for the interpreted version of gziphandler\ncompared to the compiled version, which is to us an acceptable cost for to the\nbenefits of dynamically extending foour server.\n\nOne important factor is that the gzip compression itself is provided by the\nstandard lib, already compiled, and exposed to the interpreter by Use().\n\nInterpreters work best at providing the glue language and offloading CPU\nintensive computations to optimized compiled libraries. With Go and Yaegi, this\ncan be achieved simply and almost transparently.\n\nConclusion\nWe are announcing Yaegi, a Go interpreter. It’s a young project and as such, far\nfrom perfect. Yaegi is open source and needs your feedback and contributions. We\nhope to make it as useful as possible for the Go community and beyond. This is\nonly the beginning. At Containous, we are focused on solving practical problems\nthrough innovative solutions.
