As a result, the team managed a multitude of\ncontainer platforms, each having a unique networking configuration and runtime\nto operate. This made management of these environments very difficult and time\nconsuming because each network change needed to be applied one-by-one for each\nand every environment (i.e. Amazon ECS and Kubernetes, Mesos and Marathon, etc). \n\n\nThe team set out to find a proxy solution flexible enough to work across\nmultiple platforms such as Consul, Mesos, and Kubernetes, while integrating\nnatively with each platform’s unique discovery mechanisms and information\nmodels. What they needed was a single reverse proxy solution to standardize and\nconsolidate the existing disparate solutions to reduce operational overhead, s\nimplify new deployments, and minimize human errors during configuration changes.\nGiven the company’s size, the “perfect” solution would need to meet specific\nrequirements around massive scalability, ease and speed of deployment, and\nfunction efficiently in highly-dynamic containerized environments.\n\n\nSolution\nThe leading travel company’s infrastructure team stumbled onto Traefik while\nevaluating and testing different solutions in the networking landscape of the\ncontainerized world. \n\n\nTraefik offers the ability for engineering teams to plug in multiple data\nsources, such as Mesos, Marathon, Consul, etc, all with the use of a single\ntool.

Wim’s\nteam specifically is chartered to deliver a platform that is capable of handling\ntraffic peaks and scale according to demand, ensuring that the marketplace is\nalways available when anybody wants to buy or sell anything.\n\nThe platform is a containerized set of microservices, deployed to the cloud, to\ntake advantage of the scalability and availability offered by cloud resources.\nThis platform is quite large, hosting and managing hundreds of microservices.\n\nRouting and load balancing in a dynamic and complex environment was a real\nchallenge for Wim’s team. Their original approach consisted of Fabio as a\ntraditional load balancer, in conjunction with a hardware load balancer, and\nNomad as their orchestrator. This setup did not scale anymore to meet the\nrouting and configuration flexibility they needed, leading them to explore other\nedge routing solutions.\n\nWim’s team needed a solution that could easily handle routing external and\ninternal traffic flow with no bottlenecks or scalability issues, while enabling\nthem to easily configure multiple advanced routes per service.\n\n> “We needed an advanced load balancer and an API Gateway for advanced routing to\ncontrol traffic flow with flexible configuration and automation capabilities.\nThis complexity makes it difficult to find a good load balancer. A load balancer\nper domain was not enough for us.”\nSolution\nWim’s teams platform strategy is to make things as simple as possible and to\nhave as few components as possible.\n\nThe team researched and conducted an extensive evaluation across a wide range of\ncompetitive software-based products in the market. Traditional solutions for\nrouting and load balancing are very configuration based, and lacked the ability\nto handle the complexity of a dynamic and advanced configuration system.\nMeanwhile, many of the new, modern alternative products are either great at load\nbalancing (TLS management, Websocket, HTTP2…), or as an API gateway (Advanced\nHTTP routing, canary, observability…), but rarely do both effectively.\n\neCG found Traefik was very well suited to natively support its requirements.\nTraefik offers an all-in-one product that is easy to use, configure and scales\nperfectly for the volume of traffic eCG Benelux sees on a daily basis. Traefik\nalso integrates with core technologies eCG is using across the company, such as\nDocker for containers, Nomad for orchestration, and Consul for service\nconfiguration management.\n\n> “We were looking for both a load balancer and an API Gateway that is easy to\nconfigure, scale, and secure.”\neCG uses Traefik for load balancing and as an API Gateway to route external and\ninternal traffic. Traefik is today deployed across various platforms.\n\nWim’s team has hundreds of services running behind the API Gateway. Since\ndeploying Traefik nearly a year ago, they have achieved zero downtime while\nhandling traffic peak of 22k requests per second. In terms of configuration,\nTraefik’s ability to react to their dynamic environment by automatically\nconfiguring itself accelerates and simplifies deployments without having\nmanually touch or configure anything.\n\neCG favors open source software for its infrastructure because it gives them the\nability to change the product if needed. The fact that they are not locked-in\nwith any vendor and can contribute to open source software is very important for\nWim’s team. Traefik open source software gives eCG full access to the source\ncode and the opportunity to implement changes if needed.\n\n> “Traefik gives us flexibility and avoid any vendor lock-in.”\nBottom Line\nWim’s team has been able to improve development velocity and operational\nefficiency with Traefik by saving their team hours of work on configuration\ntasks, while achieving 24x7 availability across the entire Benelux.\n\nWhat’s Next?\n * Get started with Traefik [/traefik/] today\n * Ready for production deployments?
