We’re creating a simple, unified stack that can be\nused to manage the entire network across data centers, on-premises servers and\npublic clouds all the way out to the edge.”\n\nTraefik Labs developed the Traefik application proxy as a cloud-native\nalternative to traditional solutions, which lacked features like service\ndiscovery, automation and autoscaling—all of which were important to enterprises\nadopting microservices. Traefik quickly became popular for its ease of use, open\nsource architecture and native support for cluster technologies including\nDocker, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, Mesos and many more.\n\n“We created Traefik because we needed application networking that could handle\nthe complexity and scale of the cloud. It turned out, a lot of other people\nwanted the same thing: open source networking built from the ground up for\nDevOps and microservices. Since Traefik is at the heart of everything we do, it\nwas natural to make it the heart of our identity as well,” Vauge said.\n\nTraefik has won the trust of some of the world’s largest online businesses,\nincluding Conde Nast, eBay Classifieds and Mailchimp, amassing 30,000 stars on\nGitHub. \n\n“I wish all networking software were designed as well as Traefik,” said Pierre\nBourgeois, DevOps engineer at Worldline. “You definitely can configure the most\nadvanced ingress rules you may need; sometimes you have to get into the details,\nbut most of the time you just need your edge router to work—especially with the\ncloud and microservices, where environments are constantly changing. With\nTraefik, I don’t waste time configuring settings. Traefik finds my services and\nconfigures itself. In terms of usability and performance, it’s head and\nshoulders over any popular solution I’ve seen.”\n\nBuilding on the success of Traefik, Traefik Labs has developed a range of\nproducts extending the capabilities of its core projects. The complete list\nincludes:\n\n * Traefik Proxy (‘Traefik’), the original open-source application proxy for\n   cloud-native platforms, which provides load balancing, API gateway services\n   and ingress control.\n * Traefik Mesh (formerly Maesh), an open-source service mesh featuring Traefik\n   Labs’ signature ease of use and a unique per-node architecture.\n * Traefik Enterprise, Traefik Labs’ flagship open-core offering, which bundles\n   Traefik Proxy and Traefik Mesh along with additional features for scale,\n   security, support and deployment.\n * Traefik Pilot (new), a centralized SaaS control center and plug-in hub for\n   Traefik servers. \n\n“The growth of cloud-native architectures made Traefik Pilot essential,” Vauge\nsaid. “Enterprises aren’t just experimenting with containers and microservices\nanymore. They’re in full production, with clusters around the world. Traefik\nPilot makes it easy to run Traefik as it was meant to be run: at cloud scale.”\n\nTraefik Pilot provides observability, security and monitoring of Traefik’s\ncloud-native application proxy. Users can quickly set alerts and see real-time\nreports on the health and status of each Traefik instance, while Traefik Pilot\nautomatically checks for common vulnerabilities and exposure (CVE) bulletins and\nflags any that might need attention. \n\nTraefik Pilot’s innovative new plug-in hub also enables anyone to create,\npublish and install add-on packages that extend Traefik’s functionality.\nDevelopers can write plug-ins in Go and share them with the community as easily\nas publishing them on GitHub. Traefik Pilot users can find plug-ins directly\nfrom the catalog without compiling a single line of code. \n\n“Traefik Pilot opens up Traefik so developers can tailor it to their own needs\nand make the entire platform more capable,” Vauge said. “What makes Traefik\npowerful and even fun to use is that it provides both simplicity and\nflexibility. Traefik automates complexity away, and Traefik Pilot makes the\nnetworking stack infinitely extensible.”\n\nOver time, Traefik Labs plans to make Traefik Pilot the control center for the\nentire Traefik networking stack.\n\n“Without the right tools and approach, networking in the cloud native world is\nnotoriously complex,” said Greg Muscarella, VP of Automation and Operations\nProducts at Nutanix. “There’s a real need for a cloud-native network stack that\nfits together seamlessly, which is why our new Kubernetes-based multicloud PaaS,\nKarbon Platform Services, offers Traefik as an integrated service that\ndevelopers can easily leverage for content-based routing, load balancing and\nSSL/TLS termination. Traefik Labs’ strong focus on simplicity and ease of use\naligns with Nutanix’s goal of enabling enterprises to fast-track their\ncloud-native journey.”\n\nTraefik Labs announced $10M in Series A funding in January 2020, led by\nBalderton Capital, with participation from Elaia and 360 Capital Partners.\n\nAbout Traefik Labs\nTraefik Labs [https://traefik.io/] develops the world’s most popular\ncloud-native application networking software.

Operator is now available on Red Hat OpenShift, automating\ninstallation and maintenance across the hybrid cloud\n\nSan Francisco, CA – April 14, 2020 –Containous [/], the leading cloud-native\nnetworking company, today announced that its popular enterprise edge routing\nsolution TraefikEE [/traefikee/] has achieved Red Hat OpenShift Operator\nCertification. With this certification, TraefikEE joins the Red Hat software\ncertified partner ecosystem and is readily available through Red Hat OpenShift\n[https://www.openshift.com/products/container-platform], the industry’s most\ncomprehensive enterprise Kubernetes platform.\n\nModern enterprises are turning to containerized environments to gain agility in\nthe development of their applications. But this paradigm introduces complexity\naround networking that developers now need to mitigate through the use of many\ndiscrete tools that cannot be integrated easily or efficiently. Through its\ncentralized and automated platform, TraefikEE brings operational efficiency,\nhigh availability, increased delivery speed at scale in dynamic container\necosystems, and centralized tooling for even the largest enterprise\narchitectures. Now independent software vendors (ISVs) and Red Hat OpenShift\ncustomers can simplify the deployment, management, and scaling of applications\nthrough TraefikEE’s popular edge routing technology. The TraefikEE Operator is\nbuilt on top of Traefik [/traefik/] – the open source solution that is one of\nGitHub’s top-ten most popular projects, with more than 1.5 billion downloads.\n\nRed Hat OpenShift [https://www.openshift.com/products/container-platform] is a\nenterprise Kubernetes application platform trusted by more than 1500\norganizations to power cloud-native deployments across the hybrid cloud.\nOperators are a key component to the Red Hat OpenShift ecosystem, providing\n“as-a-service” automation at every level of the stack. Red Hat OpenShift uses\nthe power of Operators to run the entire platform in an autonomous fashion while\nexposing configuration natively through Kubernetes objects, allowing for quicker\ninstallation and more frequent updates. In addition to the automation advantages\nof Operators for managing the platform, Red Hat OpenShift makes it easier to\nfind, install and manage Operators running on clusters.\n\n“Providing the TraefikEE Operator to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform\nenables many more enterprises to simplify otherwise complex networking,” said\nGérald Croës, VP Engineering, Containous. “Businesses are looking for easy and\ncentralized ways to deploy and manage their applications. TraefikEE provides\npeace of mind when running critical applications in production, without\nrequiring any compromise on security or capacity to scale deployments.  This is\na modern reverse proxy built for the cloud, and we’re thrilled to earn\ncertification and make our TraefikEE Operator part of the Red Hat OpenShift\nworld.”\n\n“As a Red Hat-certified Operator for Red Hat OpenShift, the TraefikEE Operator\nfrom Containous is now part of the Red Hat Partner Connect ecosystem, providing\nbroader choice to our customers and ISVs,” said Julio Tapia, senior director,\nCloud Platforms ecosystem, Red Hat. “Kubernetes Operators help encode the human\noperational logic normally required to manage services running as a\nKubernetes-native application and aim to make day-to-day operations easier. By\nproviding its Operator on Red Hat OpenShift, Containous’ TraefikEE users can\nbegin experiencing the next level of benefits from a Kubernetes-native\ninfrastructure, with services designed to ‘just work’ across the cloud where\nKubernetes runs.”\n\nTraefikEE supports clustered deployments to increase security and scalability,\nand the TraefikEE Operator allows businesses to develop and deliver\nmicroservices applications more quickly and seamlessly. TraefikEE runs in\nparallel with pre-installed routers and offers essential enterprise features\nincluding cluster mode, TLS certificate management, and high availability.

With this certification, TraefikEE joins the Red Hat software certified partner ecosystem and is readily available through <a href=\"https://www.openshift.com/products/container-platform\">Red Hat OpenShift</a>, the industry’s most comprehensive enterprise Kubernetes platform.</p><p>Modern enterprises are turning to containerized environments to gain agility in the development of their applications. But this paradigm introduces complexity around networking that developers now need to mitigate through the use of many discrete tools that cannot be integrated easily or efficiently. Through its centralized and automated platform, TraefikEE brings operational efficiency, high availability, increased delivery speed at scale in dynamic container ecosystems, and centralized tooling for even the largest enterprise architectures. Now independent software vendors (ISVs) and Red Hat OpenShift customers can simplify the deployment, management, and scaling of applications through TraefikEE’s popular edge routing technology. The TraefikEE Operator is built on top of <a href=\"https://containous.ghost.io/traefik/\">Traefik</a> – the open source solution that is one of GitHub’s top-ten most popular projects, with more than 1.5 billion downloads.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.openshift.com/products/container-platform\">Red Hat OpenShift</a> is a enterprise Kubernetes application platform trusted by more than 1500 organizations to power cloud-native deployments across the hybrid cloud. Operators are a key component to the Red Hat OpenShift ecosystem, providing “as-a-service” automation at every level of the stack. Red Hat OpenShift uses the power of Operators to run the entire platform in an autonomous fashion while exposing configuration natively through Kubernetes objects, allowing for quicker installation and more frequent updates. In addition to the automation advantages of Operators for managing the platform, Red Hat OpenShift makes it easier to find, install and manage Operators running on clusters.</p><p>“Providing the TraefikEE Operator to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform enables many more enterprises to simplify otherwise complex networking,” said Gérald Croës, VP Engineering, Containous. “Businesses are looking for easy and centralized ways to deploy and manage their applications. TraefikEE provides peace of mind when running critical applications in production, without requiring any compromise on security or capacity to scale deployments.  This is a modern reverse proxy built for the cloud, and we’re thrilled to earn certification and make our TraefikEE Operator part of the Red Hat OpenShift world.”</p><p>“As a Red Hat-certified Operator for Red Hat OpenShift, the TraefikEE Operator from Containous is now part of the Red Hat Partner Connect ecosystem, providing broader choice to our customers and ISVs,” said Julio Tapia, senior director, Cloud Platforms ecosystem, Red Hat. “Kubernetes Operators help encode the human operational logic normally required to manage services running as a Kubernetes-native application and aim to make day-to-day operations easier. By providing its Operator on Red Hat OpenShift, Containous’ TraefikEE users can begin experiencing the next level of benefits from a Kubernetes-native infrastructure, with services designed to ‘just work’ across the cloud where Kubernetes runs.”</p><p>TraefikEE supports clustered deployments to increase security and scalability, and the TraefikEE Operator allows businesses to develop and deliver microservices applications more quickly and seamlessly. TraefikEE runs in parallel with pre-installed routers and offers essential enterprise features including cluster mode, TLS certificate management, and high availability. The TraefikEE Operator is now available in the <a href=\"https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/explore\">Red Hat Container Catalog</a> and via <a href=\"https://operatorhub.io/operator/traefikee-operator\">OperatorHub</a>.<br></p><p><strong>Resources:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://containous.ghost.io/\">Containous</a></li><li><a href=\"https://containous.ghost.io/traefikee/\">TraefikEE</a></li><li>Download <a href=\"https://catalog.redhat.com/software/operators/explore\">Red Hat OpenShift Operators</a></li><li>Follow<a href=\"https://twitter.com/containous\"> @Containous</a> and<a href=\"https://twitter.com/traefik\"> @Traefik</a> on Twitter </li></ul><p><strong>About Containous</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://containous.ghost.io/\">Containous</a> brings the future of cloud-native networking by offering powerful tools to ease the deployment of your modern IT environments.
