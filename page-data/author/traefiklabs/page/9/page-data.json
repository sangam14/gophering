The new initiative rewards\ncommunity members with a variety of Ambassador perks and establishes\norganizational resources to empower community contributions and involvement.\n\nTraefik, the open source cloud-native edge router, has now been downloaded from\nDocker Hub over 1.2 billion times – with more than half of those downloads in\nthe past six months – and has over 25,000 stars on GitHub. Version 2.0 was\nrecently released, which gives software development teams more control and\nnetworking capabilities for their applications.\n\n“We are thrilled to be launching our new program to acknowledge and support the\nactive and diverse group of committed developers that make up the Traefik\ncommunity,” said Patricia Dugan, Head of Community, Containous. “With the\nTraefik Ambassador Program, we can reward the many ways our community\naccelerates the interaction of knowledge between Traefik users, and we can\nbetter support this large and passionate community both on and offline. By\njoining this community program, contributors will have focused resources to\nsupport their contributions and exciting new perks that reward their efforts.”\n\nThe Traefik Ambassador Program is open to all developers, and rewards various\ntypes of contribution:\n\n * Code: Add code, fix bugs, or supply documentation.\n * Content: Contribute technical blogs or technical videos on Traefik best\n   practices and implementation how-tos.\n * Community Builder: Be a teacher, speaker, or event organizer. Let the\n   Containous team support your efforts, while you build your own Traefik Meetup\n   Community.\n * Traefik Online Meetup Presenter: Showcase the ways you use Traefik to solve\n   key technical challenges within your organization in front of an online\n   audience.\n\n“I’m all about the new Traefik Ambassador program, which is built specifically\nfor Traefik Community members, those who use and are fans of Traefik. Traefik\nenables our team to consolidate tools and workflows without adding complexity to\nour projects. The Traefik Ambassador program is focused on supporting\ncontributors of code, content and expertise by way of resources and promotion,\nwhich I think is awesome, and necessary. The program will help me and other\nambassadors bring Traefik closer to the local communities, and give back to the\nOpen Source ecosystem.” — Brian Christner, Docker Captain & Co-Founder\n56K.Cloud.\n\nContainous is dedicated to supporting developers in the Traefik Ambassador\nProgram with any help needed to launch meetups or speaking efforts, promoting\ncontributors’ work to a wider audience through social channels, and delivering\nspecial Traefik Ambassador swag.
