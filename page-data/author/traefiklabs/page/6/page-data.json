Capital leads the round as Containous’ open source, cloud-native\nnetworking solutions top 1.4 billion downloads and see accelerated enterprise\nadoption throughout 2019\n\nSan Francisco, CA – January 13, 2020 – Containous [/], the leading cloud-native\nnetworking company, today announced it has closed $10 million in Series A\nfunding. The round is led by Balderton Capital [https://www.balderton.com/],\nwith previous investors Elaia [https://www.elaia.com/] and 360 Capital Partners\n[https://www.360cap.vc/] also participating. In addition to a massive open\nsource community, Containous’ popular networking solutions are trusted and\ndeployed by enterprises such as eBay, Condé Nast, and Nutanix. The company\nsimplifies the journey to microservices networking for organizations of all\nsizes, who use Containous’ solutions to ease networking of their cloud\napplications, microservices, and APIs.\n\nThe $10 million Series A will be used to quickly build up and expand Containous’\nunified and centralized management platform purpose-built for cloud-native\napplications and microservices. The platform – the first-of-its-kind – is driven\nentirely by developers and created to function as one single tool that solves\nnetworking complexity. Containous will also significantly increase its\nengineering and product teams to accelerate product development for the benefit\nof the wider open source community and for enterprises looking to build, ship,\nand run applications faster and more efficiently. \n\n\n“By taking the pain out of network management, we empower application and\nengineering teams to focus on software development,” said Emile Vauge, CEO and\nfounder, Containous. “With Containous, users are free to build, iterate, and\nship their applications rather than wasting valuable cycles on networking and\ninfrastructure. We want development teams to view networking as a commodity,\nbecause that’s what it really should be.” \n\n\n“At Balderton, we are very excited about the emergence of organic online\ncommunities – and some of the most productive and powerful communities to emerge\nover the past decade have come from globally decentralized teams collaborating\non open source infrastructure software,” said Bernard Liautaud, Managing\nPartner, Balderton Capital. “We believe that being open source is becoming a\nprerequisite for widely-adopted, high-quality infrastructure software today, and\nthat the most compelling and strategic aspect of open source software is a\nstrong community driving the creation, development and, ultimately, the adoption\nof that software. The team at Containous has led the massive Traefik community\nwith tremendous success over the last few years, and we are humbled to be\njoining it. With IDC forecasting that there will be more than 1.8 billion\nenterprise container instances by 2021\n[https://goto.docker.com/rs/929-FJL-178/images/IDC-containerplatform-wp.pdf], we\nanticipate Containous will increasingly play a very meaningful – and welcome –\nrole in developers' workflows. We look forward to playing an active role in the\ncommunity as Containous continues to evolve its core product, Traefik, alongside\nits newer releases (Maesh and TraefikEE) to transform networking for businesses,\ndevelopers, and end users around the world.”\n\n\nContainous delivers three solutions for drastically simplifying networking:\n\n\n * Traefik [/traefik/] is the cloud-native edge router that manages inbound\n   connections from the internet to the infrastructure. The open source solution\n   is built to be easy to use, dynamic and automatic, and is integrated with all\n   major cloud-native tools and orchestrators. Traefik is designed from the\n   ground-up for microservices and containers.\n * TraefikEE [/traefikee/] is the production-grade and distributed version of\n   Traefik developed for – and trusted by – larger enterprises. The EE version\n   splits proxies and controllers to increase security, supports cluster\n   deployment through high scalability and availability, and includes a\n   dashboard, operations tools, and bundled 24/7 support.\n * Maesh [/maesh/] is a very easy to use (but feature-rich) service mesh built\n   on top of Traefik that is capable of managing service-to-service\n   communications inside a Kubernetes cluster with a non-invasive and per-node\n   design (as opposed to side-car proxy architectures). The solution is\n   SMI-compliant.\n   \n\nContainous’ Series A infusion comes at a time of explosive growth for the\nnetworking company. Traefik, which debuted version 2.0 in September 2019, has\nnow been downloaded more than 1.4 billion times from Docker Hub (with two-thirds\nof those in the past six months) and has hundreds of thousands of deployments\nworldwide in companies spanning all sizes and industries. Traefik has particular\nmomentum in the enterprise space, counting eBay, Condé Nast, Nutanix, Talend,\nMozilla, and PrestaShop among the users leveraging the solution in production\nenvironments. Born in – and powered by – an extraordinary open source community\n[https://community.containo.us/c/traefik], Traefik is one of the most popular\ninfrastructure projects in the world, with more than 26K stars on GitHub\n[https://github.com/containous/traefik].\n\n“Enterprise IT is undergoing a major revolution, driven by Cloud and Edge\ncomputing and by DevOps practices,” said Marc Rougier, Partner, Elaia.\n“Containous’ mission is to develop best of breed, open source, end-to-end\nsolutions to serve Enterprise networking needs within this new technological\ncontext. At Elaia we invested early in Containous, convinced by Emile Vauge’s\nvision and impressed by the exceptionally fast adoption of their initial\nproduct, Traefik. Two years later, Containous has crushed the 1 billion\ndownloads barrier, delivered to top customers around the world, and extended its\nproduct portfolio. We are very proud to now partner with Balderton to tackle the\nnext phase of Containous’ scale up.”\n\nAbout Containous\nContainous [/] brings the future of cloud-native networking by offering powerful\ntools to ease the deployment of your modern IT environments.
