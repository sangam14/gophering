Traefik is now able to\nconnect to a swarm manager and will discover all services deployed on the swarm.\nThank you diegofernandes [https://github.com/diegofernandes] for your work :)\n\nConstraints\nsamber [https://github.com/samber] initiated the addition of constraints, that\nlimits Traefik scope to a smaller number of routes. It allows to easily deploy\nmultiple instances with specific roles.\nLet’s give an example and add this line to our TOML configurations:\n\n# traefik instance 1\nconstraints = [“tag==eu-*”, “tag==asia-*”]\n\n# traefik instance 2\nconstraints = [“tag==us-*”]\n\nThe instance 1 will now route services tagged with eu-* or asia-* (i.e. \neu-backend, eu-frontend, asia-data…) and the instance 2, services tagged with \nus-*.\nYou can use Docker labels, Marathon labels or Consul Catalog tags to tag your\nservices. For example, let’s deploy a new Docker application and tag it:\n\ndocker run -d -l traefik.tags=eu-frontend emilevauge/whoami\n\n\nThis application will be taken into account by traefik instance 1 and ignored by\ninstance 2.\n\nMesos backend\nPierreLeresteux [https://github.com/PierreLeresteux] & skydjol\n[https://github.com/skydjol] made a great pull request adding universal Mesos\nsupport to Traefik. In addition to Marathon\n[https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/], Traefik can now be used with any Mesos\nframework (i.e. Chronos, Aurora, custom…). And yeah, the v1.1 codename is \ncamembert because of those Normans [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normans] guys!\n\nWhy not Saint-Nectaire\n[https://github.com/containous/traefik/pull/353#issuecomment-233914436]?Session\naffinity\nLong awaited [https://github.com/containous/traefik/issues/5#issue-107706542] \nsticky sessions are now supported thanks to owen [https://github.com/owen]! Use\nthem with caution [https://12factor.net/processes] ;)\n\nCluster mode (experimental)\nTraefik now has a cluster mode, which allows to deploy multiple instances\nsharing the same configuration. To do that without copying the same\nconfiguration file on each instance, Traefik uses a distributed Key-Value store\n(Etcd, Consul supported). What is great with cluster mode is that it works with\nLet’s Encrypt, using the Key-Value database to store the TLS certificates. \nCluster mode [https://docs.traefik.io/] is available in this release as an\nexperimental feature.\n\nOfficial Alpine image\nIn addition to the official “from scratch” Docker image, there is now an\nofficial Alpine image tagged v1.1.0-alpine, camembert-alpine. This can be useful\nto get a shell access to a Traefik container for debugging purpose.\n\nExperimental builds\nFor those who want to test bleeding edge features, we introduced experimental\nbuilds. Each time a pull request is merged into master branch, a docker image\nwill be pushed at:\n\ncontainous/traefik:experimental\n\nA specific PR image will also be pushed at:\n\ncontainous/traefik:pr-#\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGrab the latest binary for Linux, Windows, Mac on Github\n[https://github.com/containous/traefik/releases/tag/v1.1.0] or get the official\nDocker image [https://hub.docker.com/_/traefik/]!\n\ndocker pull traefik:v1.1.0\ndocker pull traefik:v1.1.0-alpine\ndocker pull traefik:camembert\ndocker pull traefik:camembert-alpine\n\nThe documentation can be found on http://docs.traefik.io\n[https://docs.traefik.io/].\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinally, we are very pleased to announce that dtomcej\n[https://github.com/dtomcej] and SantoDE [https://github.com/SantoDE] just\njoined the maintainers team.
