But what if you are the only\nmachine learning engineer on the project? You must automate these tests as much\nas possible. And what if you have to make dozens of iterations per year and\nsometimes deploy new versions several times a week? Here is my story about the\npersonalization of a large-scale book reading service and building the\ninfrastructure to evaluate new models utilizing Traefik.\n\nAbout MyBook\nMyBook [https://mybook.ru/] is a subscription reading service that publishes\nbook apps for multiple platforms while striving to provide the best reading\nexperience for our users. We've collected a huge catalog of books, audiobooks,\nratings, and summaries that are conveniently always in your pocket. Bookmarks\nare synced across all our user’s devices and text-audiobook versions. Avid\nreaders can use a subscription with unlimited reading, and those who want just\none book can rent it for half price. My name is Alexander Dmitriev, and I am a\nmachine learning engineer. My field of interest is personalization: recommender\nsystems [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system], user satisfaction\nmeasurement [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_user_satisfaction], and\ninfrastructure for these systems. I love to solve problems end-to-end: discuss\nthe user interface with the product manager, prepare data, train machine\nlearning models, write the service, deploy to production, and support it.\n\nBuilding a Smart(er) Recommendation Engine\nHelping customers find books that are interesting to them is essential for a\nretail service like ours. MyBook already has talented editors curating popular\nbook selections, so the next logical step was adding frequently updated personal\nrecommendations. When I started at MyBook, my goal was to build a recommender\nsystem that discovered and suggested books that a customer might find\ninteresting based on their behaviors. This service is known internally as recsys\n, and I'll be focusing on the evolution, automation, and maturation of that\nsystem in this post.\n\nProduction testing is critical for the development of machine learning systems\nlike recsys. Simulating ephemeral properties such as serendipity, variety, and\nrelevance is not feasible with more traditional approaches to testing such as\nunit or integration methodologies used during software development.\n\nWhen the first version of the recommender service was ready, I added a Flask\nserver, built a Docker container, and deployed it on a newly purchased cloud\nserver. Backend engineers added NGINX as a reverse proxy with SSL support\nbecause it had been used for many years on our production systems. The recsys \napplication Flask port was published to the host, and all requests were\nforwarded.\n\nSo, at first, the architecture looked like this:\n\nThe Growing Pains of Productionized Testing\nWe regularly performed A/B tests where we measured the mean number\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean] of books our users added to their\nbookshelves during a single session. The end results showed us that personalized\nsets performed 30% better than a fixed set of bestsellers handpicked by our\neditors. Eventually, all new versions of recsys rolled out through the A/B test\nagainst the previous one in production. And it looked something like this:\n\nAs time passed and new services appeared, the situation became messy and\nunmanageable:\n\n * Many of the recsys services ports were hardcoded on the backend\n * Prior to each A/B test the health checks, Prometheus exports, alerting rules,\n   and Grafana dashboards had to be configured by hand\n * This process was required any time a new version of recsys was deployed\n\nAs mentioned before, user tests are must-have in personalization tasks and it's\ncrucial to be able to set up and teardown one as quickly and easily as possible,\notherwise this overhead would have driven our velocity and impact close to zero.\n\nMachine Learning at Scale\nAt this stage, it was clear that a better solution was required. I spent some\ntime researching concepts such as service discovery, canary deployments, and\ncloud-native. Eventually, I discovered Traefik [/traefik/], a nice and easy to\nuse reverse-proxy and load balancer which works natively with Docker containers\nand Docker Swarm.\n\nAfter reading the Traefik documentation [https://docs.traefik.io] I discovered\nthat I would get:\n\n * auto-discovery of new containers\n * health checks and routing only to healthy containers\n * metrics endpoint for Prometheus\n * configuration via Docker labels which means all my infrastructure will be\n   described alongside my deployment manifests, perfect\n * no more exposed ports on my containers, now they are secure and accessible\n   only inside the Docker network\n\nFor a long time, I was curious about the the multi-armed bandit\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit] approach for recsys tests.\nThe idea of this approach is to optimize some kind of reward (e.g. user\nsatisfaction) during the constant test with adjustments made on the fly and to\nminimize resources (e.g. user sessions) used during the exploration of new\nchoices (recsys models). It seems perfect if you want to test every small\niteration or even several versions of service at the same time.\n\nI ended up building a couple of different prototypes and came to this solution:\n\nEvery service became a router in Traefik terminology, and each recommender\nengine container became a service [https://docs.traefik.io/routing/services/].\n\nTraefik made it possible to assign multiple Docker services to one routing rule\n[https://docs.traefik.io/routing/routers/] and split traffic between services\nwhile assigning\n[https://docs.traefik.io/routing/services/#weighted-round-robin-service] weights\nto each one. So here is the most interesting part:\n\n * The sum of all weights for different versions of the recsys would always\n   equal 100\n * All new versions were deployed with weight 1, so they received only 1% of\n   user traffic\n * Several times a day Python script recalculated recommender performance\n   metrics for each version of recommender (for simplicity let's say CTR or \n   click-through rate [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click-through_rate]) and\n   updated weights for models; so better performing ones receive more user\n   requests while others receive less\n\nTesting a new version of the recommender engine is as simple as adding a service\ndefinition to the docker-compose file and updating the stack. Docker Swarm finds\nthe difference between the desired and current state, starts a new Docker\ncontainer with `weight = 1`. Traefik finds this container and, after successful\nhealth checks, routes 1% of requests to the new version, all while exporting the\nmetrics required for monitoring by our automated scripts. After a set amount of\ntime the CTR metrics are recalculated and if users like the new version, it is\nreconfigured to receive a larger share of the traffic, and it is constantly\nbeing reevaluated against new models.\n\nTraefik Helps Me Do What I Love Most\nWe are a small team and I am the only MLE on the project, so I insist on\nresearching and utilizing tools that are easy to use and built with love for the\nend-user. Traefik definitely meets that criteria. Maintenance costs are close to\nzero, and the learning curve is flat. This approach is pretty universal no\nmatter which container orchestrator you use and how you configure Traefik,\nwhether you’re using Kubernetes, Docker labels, Consul, Etcd, or something else.\n\nIn summary, I’d recommend Traefik [/traefik/] to anyone who needs reverse proxy\nwith all necessary features such as service discovery, monitoring, and metrics\nexporting, which is easy to set up and maintain. It saved me a ton of time so\nthat I could now spend fine-tuning algorithms and adding personal ranking to\neditors' handpicked book sets, which help users find the books they like. All\nthis effort yielded book consumption increase by tens of percent.\n\nAuthor's Bio\nAlex Dmitriev is an engineer in embedded electronics and data scientist in\nmetallurgy.
