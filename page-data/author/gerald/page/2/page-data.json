After three months of development and five release candidates, we are\nproud to announce the release of Traefik 1.7, codename “maroilles\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maroilles_cheese]”.\n\nWe’ve merged more pull requests than ever\n[https://github.com/containous/traefik/milestone/9?closed=1] from our\never-growing community of contributors that has reached more than 300\nindividuals. Thanks go to every one of you; we are in awe before your enthusiasm\nat improving Traefik.\n\nThe full changelog is available here\n[https://github.com/containous/traefik/releases/tag/v1.7.0], but we wanted to\nhighlight our favorite features.\n\nLet’s Encrypt & The New TLS Challenge in Town\nLet’s Encrypt integration is one of the most praised features of Traefik, so\nwhen Let’s Encrypt faced the TLS-SNI-01 challenge incident\n[https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/2018-01-09-issue-with-tls-sni-01-and-shared-hosting-infrastructure/49996]\n, some of our users were left with few (yet satisfactory) alternatives. But when \nthey introduced the TLS ALPN Challenge\n[https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/tls-alpn-validation-method/63814], Ludovic\nFernandez [https://github.com/ldez] was pleased to make it available right away\nso the community could once again pick a TLS based challenge.\n\n[acme] \n   # … \n   entryPoint = \"https\" \n   [acme.tlsChallenge] #enables the TLS ALPN Challenge\n\n\nOne of the advantage of TLS based challenges? They only require port 443 to be\nopen.\n\nA Docker Image for Windows\nBecause we didn’t want to let down our Windows user base, Traefik now has its\nofficial Windows Docker image [https://hub.docker.com/_/traefik/]!\n\nThat’s correct: no more tinkering with custom builds, you’ll get your Traefik\ninstance right out of the box on your Windows Server infrastructure.\n\nFor compatibility reasons, our image is currently based on Windows \nnanoserver-sac2016, but rest assured that more recent nano server images are on\ntheir way.\n\nOur thanks go to Stefan Scherer [https://github.com/StefanScherer] who harnessed\nhis expertise to make this happen, and to Damien Duportal\n[https://github.com/dduportal] who fearlessly dove into the subject.\n\nH2C Support\nJulien Salleyron [https://github.com/Juliens] would explain it better than I do,\nbut basically, H2C is a way to do HTTP2 without certificates.\n\n> Wait … why is that useful?\nWell, when you have lots of gRPC services on your infrastructure (that by\ndefault use TLS), not having to handle a certificate for each service is a\nsimplification you will probably welcome.\n\nThis is why Traefik now supports incoming H2C requests, either by upgrading\nHTTP1 connections or dealing with “Prior Knowledge” requests.\n\nYou can also tell Traefik that your backend servers support H2C (using the \ntraefik.protocol=h2c label or the relevant option for your provider), in which\ncase Traefik will send HTTP2 requests (with prior knowledge) to them.\n\nTo make things even better, Traefik accepts both H2C requests and HTTP1 requests\non the same entrypoint (port). No need to separate your workload.\n\nAWS Fargate\nReleased worldwide earlier this year, Amazon has deployed AWS Fargate — a\ncompute engine for Amazon ECS that allows you to run containers without having\nto manage servers or clusters.\n\nAs always, you can count on Traefik to support your favorite cluster technology!\nIn case you decide to run mixed clusters with EC2 and Fargate components,\nTraefik will seamlessly detect them and work with them with no additional\nefforts on your part (since Michael Matur [https://github.com/mmatur] already\ndid the job).\n\nAuth in Frontends\nYou can now configure authentication on the frontend layer, which provides\nfine-grain control on what needs to be secured.\n\nThanks go to Zatte [https://github.com/Zatte] who provided the feature for the\nKubernetes provider (and the idea itself).\n\nExcerpts from the documentation for the file provider:\n\n[frontends.myfrontend.auth]\n   headerField = \"X-WebAuth-User\"\n \n   [frontends.myfrontend.auth.basic] \n      users = [ \"test:$apr1$H6uskkkW$IgXLP6ewTrSuBkTrqE8wj/\",\n                \"test2:$apr1$d9hr9HBB$4HxwgUir3HP4EsggP/QNo0\",]\n\n\nYou can also check the new authentication options available for the K8S Ingress\nprovider to get a better idea of what’s possible.\n\nSecurity\nTraefik has become a critical component for many, and we want Traefik to be safe\nfor everyone. To help us ensure that, even though these actions are not “per se”\nnew features, we have created a new security mailing list (\nsecurity+subscribe@traefik.io\n[https://groups.google.com/a/traefik.io/forum/#!forum/security]) you can\nsubscribe to. We will use this mailing list in case there is a security issue\nthat requires your attention.\n\nAnother significant step toward making Traefik as safe as possible is the new\nform you can use to report a vulnerability [https://security.traefik.io/] you\nmight discover. By using this form, you will alert us first and give us the\nopportunity to fix a potential problem before it impacts others in a negative\nway.\n\nWe really appreciate your help on this sensitive topic.\n\nAnd Much, Much More…\nDaniel Tomcej [https://github.com/dtomcej] improved the TLS handshake, Andrew\nStucki [https://github.com/andrewstucki] added constraints support on ECS and \nallowed the binding of ECS container port, Michael Arenzon\n[https://github.com/marenzo] added support for stale reads from Consul catalog, \nOndrej Flidr [https://github.com/SniperCZE] tweaked the health check to add\nsupport for 3xx codes, Jesse Haka [https://github.com/zetaab] added HTTP headers\nto the healthcheck, Kim Min [https://github.com/yue9944882] made it possible to\nspecify backend servers’ weight in Kubernetes, Ryarnya\n[https://github.com/ryarnyah] enabled an async option to improve log\nperformances, Rodrigo Díez [https://github.com/rodrigodiez] (for his first PR!)\nadded a duration filter for the logs, Timo Reimann\n[https://github.com/timoreimann] added support for multi-port services in K8s,\nand the list goes on.\n\nOnce again, we improved many things behind the curtain and kept working to make\nTraefik better for everyone. You can check the whole changelog\n[https://github.com/containous/traefik/releases/tag/v1.7.0] to catch a glimpse\nof the awesome work that has been done on this release.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBefore You Go: The Future Has Begun!\nEven if the spoiler season has not yet begun, some of our dedicated contributors\nhave noticed — things are brewing in the master branch, things we’ve been\nwilling to do for a long time, things that have been postponed until now and\nthat we’re excited to work on.\n\nYes, for now I agree that this cryptic message won’t help you find out what’s\ncoming next, but we’re sure that you’ve already guessed that the next version\nwill be huge.\n\nWe’ve decided to unlock all the constraints we had with the stable branch and to\nwork on features we couldn’t easily implement because of the current\narchitecture (and because of compatibility reasons). Our goal with the next\nversion is to set everything up so we can welcome an endless panel of new\nfeatures, so we can provide greater flexibility to our users (yes, you’ll soon\nbe able to go even further when defining your routes).\n\nTo this day, we’ve only updated the code base to get rid of the deprecated\nelements, but we’ll soon need to introduce breaking changes to test our ideas.\nWhat matters here is that we want to share our vision with you so we can hear\nyour feedback. These changes will not be final choices; they will be proposals\nput to the trial of the community — features matter only if they match your\nneeds.\n\nWhat does that mean?\nIt means that the master branch will drift apart from the current stable branch\nto become the future branch. However, until the future is now, it will remain in\nconstant evolution and prone to change with little notice.\n\nThis is the reason why we encourage our users and contributors to not use the\nmaster branch for their production system. This is also the reason why, in the\nmeantime, we’ll be pickier with features introduced in the current branch and\noften redirect you to the master branch: so you can also be involved in the big\nnext.\n\n> Traefik is an open source project at its core, and we want to keep it this way —\nthank you for being part of its success!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGrab the latest binaries for Linux, Windows, and Mac on Github or get the\nofficial Docker image!\n\ndocker pull traefik:v1.7.0 (or 1.7.0, v1.7, 1.7, maroilles)\ndocker pull traefik:v1.7.0-alpine (or 1.7.0-alpine, v1.7-alpine, 1.7-alpine, maroilles-alpine)\ndocker pull traefik:1.7-nanoserver\n\n\nThe versioned documentation can be found on https://docs.traefik.io\n[https://docs.traefik.io/].\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBy the way, if you want to join an incredible team so you can express your every\ntalent: We are hiring!
