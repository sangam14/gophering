(But\nstay on hold because I know for sure that others will follow suit\n[https://github.com/containous/traefik/pull/5899].)\n\nImproving the CRD\nStickiness\nThe stickiness option is the ability for a load balancer to keep using the same\ntarget for a client once it has been sent to one. This option is now available\nfor our CRD users!\n\napiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1\nkind: IngressRoute\nmetadata:\n  name: myName\n  namespace: myNamespace\nspec:\n  entryPoints:\n  - web\n  routes:\n  - kind: Rule\n    match: Host(`some-domain`)\n    services:\n    - kind: Service\n      name: myService\n      namespace: myNamespace\n      port: 80\n      sticky:\n        cookie: {} # Once a pod is selected for a client, it will stay the same for future calls\n\nService Load Balancing & Mirroring\nIntroduced in 2.0, service load balancing and mirroring were previously\nexclusively configurable using the file provider\n[https://docs.traefik.io/v2.0/providers/file/]. With 2.1 and the introduction of\nthe TraefikService object, we leveraged Traefik's CRD to enable such\nconfiguration in Kubernetes, and here is a first example with mirroring:\n\napiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1\nkind: IngressRoute\nmetadata:\n  name: my-route-to-mirroring\n  namespace: default\n\nspec:\n  entryPoints:\n    - web\n  routes:\n  - match: Host(`some-domain`) && PathPrefix(`/some/path`)\n    kind: Rule\n    services:\n    - name: mirroring-example #targets the mirroring-example service\n      namespace: default\n      kind: TraefikService # we want to target the TraefikService we've declared (and not a K8S service named mirroring-example)\n---\napiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1\nkind: TraefikService\nmetadata:\n  name: mirroring-example\n  namespace: default\nspec:\n  mirroring:\n    name: v1 #sends 100% of the requests to the K8S service \"v1\" ...\n    mirrors:\n      - name: v2 # ... and sends a copy of 10% of the requests to v2\n        percent: 10\n        port: 80\n\nFor our second example, let's see how we could use service load balancing to do\ncanary deployments:\n\napiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1\nkind: IngressRoute\nmetadata:\n  name: my-route-to-canary\n  namespace: default\nspec:\n  entryPoints:\n    - web\n  routes:\n  - match: Host(`some-domain`) && PathPrefix(`/some/path`)\n    kind: Rule\n    services:\n    - name: mirror1\n      namespace: default\n      kind: TraefikService\n---\napiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1\nkind: TraefikService\nmetadata:\n  name: canary-example\n  namespace: default\n\nspec:\n  weighted:\n    services:\n      - name: v1\n        weight: 80\n        port: 80\n      - name: v2\n        weight: 20\n        port: 80\n\nWe can now change the weight for each service (v1 and v2) at will!\n\nMixing Regular (Kubernetes) Services with TraefikServices\nWhen you define a target (with the name attribute) for your IngressRoute, by\ndefault, it targets a regular Service. If you want to target the new \nTraefikService objects, you just specify the kind attribute. What's great with\nthis system is that you can chain and combine them at will, creating intricate\npatterns depending on your needs.\n\nBelow is an example that leverages both services and TraefikServices, and that\nuses mirroring and service load balancing at the same time!\n\napiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1\nkind: IngressRoute\nmetadata:\n  name: route-to-mirroring\n  namespace: default\nspec:\n  entryPoints:\n    - web\n  routes:\n  - match: Host(`some-domain`) && PathPrefix(`/some/path`)\n    kind: Rule\n    services:\n    - name: mirroring-example\n      namespace: default\n      kind: TraefikService\n---\napiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1\nkind: TraefikService\nmetadata:\n  name: mirroring-example\n  namespace: default\nspec:\n  mirroring:\n    name: canary-example\n    kind: TraefikService\n    mirrors:\n      - name: service-mirror\n        percent: 20\n        port: 80\n---\napiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1\nkind: TraefikService\nmetadata:\n  name: canary-example\n  namespace: default\nspec:\n  weighted:\n    services:\n      - name: v1\n        port: 80\n        weight: 80\n      - name: v2\n        weight: 20\n        port: 80\n\nNote on Updating the CRD for 2.1\nWhile updating an installation to v2.1, it is required to apply the new CRD and\nto enhance the existing ClusterRoledefinition. You will find out how in the \nfollowing guide [https://docs.traefik.io/migration/v2/].\n\nMore Control On Internal Routing\nIn 2.0, we've made changes to make sure people would be able to properly secure\nsome critical services offered by Traefik, like the API and the Dashboard (you\ncan see an example in our Traefik & Docker 101 article\n[/blog/traefik-2-0-docker-101-fc2893944b9d/]).\n\nPursuing the ability to configure internal services further while always giving\nusers more control, the 2.1 dashboard now shows the internal routers and\nservices involved.\n\nShows the internal services for the API and the DashboardShows the internal\nrouters leading to the internal API and Dashboard services (when users don't\nexplicitly configure them)We also jumped on the opportunity to add other\nconfigurable services to the list, namely rest@internal, ping@internal, and \nprometheus@internal. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMigrating to 2.X Made Easy\nWith so many new options to customize Traefik to your every need, we understand\nthat some people can be a bit lost when migrating to 2.x, especially since\nTraefik is the kind of software that you run and forget (because it works nights\nand days without any other intervention from its users).\n\n> We have been working really hard to make this migration a matter of minutes.\nSo, if you're thinking about migrating but haven't jumped on the task yet, we\nwant to point you in the right direction:\n\n * This guide [/blog/traefik-2-0-docker-101-fc2893944b9d/] helps you truly\n   understand how Traefik 2 works on a Docker setup and will show you that 5\n   minutes are enough to have a good grasp of what you can do with it.\n * If you're looking for information about how to configure HTTPS / TLS, we\n   have\n   you covered with this guide [/blog/traefik-2-tls-101-23b4fbee81f1/]!\n * If you don't want to lose time converting your Ingress objects in Kubernetes\n   (who would want that?), we've developed a migration tool\n   [https://github.com/containous/traefik-migration-tool] that will handle it\n   for you.\n * Same goes with your traefik.toml file: the migration tool\n   [https://github.com/containous/traefik-migration-tool] can convert it for\n   you.\n * Oh, and the migration tool\n   [https://github.com/containous/traefik-migration-tool] can also convert your \n   acme.json certificate file.\n * And always feel free to engage conversation in our community forum\n   [https://community.containo.us], we read everything and do our best to\n   provide answers when we can.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSupporting the 1.X Branch for Two Years!\nOur community matters, and we don't want our users to feel rushed to migrate to\nversion 2. We prefer seeing people slowly falling in love with the new tools\nTraefik has to offer and migrate. For this reason, we've decided to extend the\nsupport of the 1.X version until the end of 2021. \n\nThat's right: you have two years ahead of you before you need to make the leap!\n(And we believe you'll find benefits in migrating to 2.X way before that.)\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext? Focusing on the User Experience\nIn the introduction, we've stated that we received (and are still receiving) a\nlot of feedback about 2.0. And let me tell you:\n\n> We listen\nApart from bringing extra features in the next release (like UDP, HTTP/3,\nKey-Value Stores, and the list goes on ...), we want to focus this release on\nthe user experience.\n\nNow that we've seen people massively use Traefik 2, we decided it's time to work\non making powerful features simpler to configure, or at least ... less verbose. \n\nSo, let's work together on making it happen!

Such a barrier can be encountered when dealing with\nHTTPS and its certificates.\n\nLuckily for us, Traefik tends to lower this kind of hurdle and makes sure that\nthere are easy ways of securely connecting your developments to the outside\nworld.\n\nThe Goal for Today\nThe challenge we’ll accept is the following — You have an HTTP service exposed\nthrough Traefik, and you want Traefik to deal with the HTTPS burden (TLS\ntermination), leaving your pristine service unspoiled by mundane technical\ndetails.\n\nWe’ll assume you have a basic understanding of Traefik on Docker and that you’re\nfamiliar with its configuration (if not, it’s time to read Traefik 2 & Docker\n101 [/blog/traefik-2-0-docker-101-fc2893944b9d/]).\n\nDuring this article, we’ll use my pet demo docker-compose file: it enables the\ndocker provider and launches a my-app application that allows us to test any\nrequest.\n\nversion: \"3\"\nservices:\n  traefik:\n    image: \"traefik:v2.0\"\n    command:\n      - --entrypoints.web.address=:80\n      - --providers.docker=true\n    ports:\n      - \"80:80\"\n    volumes:\n      - \"/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro\"\n  \n  my-app:\n    image: containous/whoami:v1.3.0\n\nGetting Things Ready\nFirst things first, let’s make sure our setup can handle HTTPS traffic on the\ndefault port (:443), and that Traefik listens to this port thanks to an \nentrypoint [https://docs.traefik.io/routing/entrypoints/] we’ll name web-secure.\n\nversion: \"3\"\nservices:\n  traefik:\n    image: \"traefik:v2.0\"\n    command:\n      - --entrypoints.web.address=:80\n      - --entrypoints.web-secure.address=:443 #Declares the web-secure entrypoint in Traefik\n      - --providers.docker=true\n    ports:\n      - \"80:80\"\n      - \"443:443\" #Docker sends requests on port 443 to Traefik on port 443\n    volumes:\n      - \"/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro\"\n  \n  my-app:\n    image: containous/whoami:v1.3.0\n\nTo avoid confusion, let’s state the obvious — We haven’t yet configured anything\nbut enabled requests on 443 to be handled by Traffic. So, no certificate\nmanagement yet!\n\nGeneral Concepts\nUltimately, in Traefik, you configure HTTPS on the router\n[https://docs.traefik.io/routing/routers/] level. While defining routes, you\ndecide whether they are HTTP routes or HTTPS routes (by default, they are HTTP\nroutes).\n\nFirst, let’s expose our my-app service on HTTP so that it handles requests on\ndomain example.com.\n\nversion: \"3\"\n\nservices:\n  # ...\n  my-app:\n    image: containous/whoami:v1.3.0\n    labels:\n      - \"traefik.http.routers.my-app.rule=Host(`example.com`)\"\n\nAnd now, see what it takes to make this route HTTPS only!\n\nversion: \"3\"\n\nservices:\n  # ...\n  my-app:\n    image: containous/whoami:v1.3.0\n    labels:\n      - \"traefik.http.routers.my-app.rule=Host(`example.com`)\"\n      - \"traefik.http.routers.my-app.tls=true\"\n\nThere, by adding the tls option to the route, we’ve made it HTTPS.\n\nThe only unanswered question left is, “Where does Traefik get its certificates\nfrom?” And the answer is, “Either from a collection of certificates you own and\nhave configured or from a fully automatic mechanism that gets them for you.”\n\nLet’s see these solutions in action!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOption 1 — Certificates You Own\nThe least magical of the two options involves creating a configuration file.\n\nSay you already own a certificate for a domain (or a collection of certificates\nfor different domains) and that you are then the proud holder of files to claim\nyour ownership of the said domain.\n\nTo have Traefik make a claim on your behalf, you’ll have to give it access to\nthe certificate files. Let’s do this.\n\nAdd a Configuration File for Certificates\n\nversion: \"3\"\n\nservices:\n  traefik:\n    image: \"traefik:v2.0\"\n    command:\n      - --entrypoints.web.address=:80\n      - --entrypoints.web-secure.address=:443\n      - --providers.docker=true\n      - --providers.file.directory=/configuration/\n      - --providers.file.watch=true\n    ports:\n      - \"80:80\"\n      - \"443:443\"\n    volumes:\n      - \"/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro\"\n      - \"/home/username/traefik/configuration/:/configuration/\"\n\nTraefik runs with many providers beyond Docker (i.e., Kubernetes\n[https://docs.traefik.io/providers/kubernetes-crd/], Rancher\n[https://docs.traefik.io/providers/rancher/], Marathon\n[https://docs.traefik.io/providers/marathon/]), and here we chose to add plain\nold configuration files (--providers.file) in the configuration/ directory (and\nwe’ll automatically reload changes with --providers.file.watch=true). We’ll use\na configuration file to declare our certificates.\n\nAdd the Certificates to the Configuration File\n# in files/certificates.toml\n\n[[tls.certificates]] #first certificate\n   certFile = “/path/to/example-com.cert” \n   keyFile = “/path/to/example-com.key”\n\n[[tls.certificates]] #second certificate\n   certFile = “/path/to/other.cert” \n   keyFile = “/path/to/other.key”\n   \n# and so on\n\nNow that we have our TOML configuration file available (thanks to the enabled\nfile provider), we can fill in certificates in the [[tls.certificates]]section.\n\nEnjoy!\nThis is all there is to do. When dealing with an HTTPS route, Traefik goes\nthrough your default certificate store to find a matching certificate.\n\nSpecifying a Default Certificate?\nIf no valid certificate is found, Traefik serves a default auto-signed\ncertificate. But if needed, you can customize the default certificate like so:\n\n[tls.stores]\n  [tls.stores.default]\n   [tls.stores.default.defaultCertificate] \n     certFile = “path/to/cert.crt” \n     keyFile = “path/to/cert.key”\n\nAdditional Thoughts\nEven though the configuration is straightforward, it is your responsibility, as\nthe administrator, to configure / renew your certificates when they expire. If\nyou don’t like such constraints, keep reading!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOption 2 — Dynamic / Automatic Certificates\nHaving to manage (buy/install/renew) your certificates is a process you might \nnot enjoy (I don’t). If so, you’ll be interested in the automatic certificate\ngeneration embedded in Traefik (thanks to Let’s Encrypt).\n\nLong story short, you can start Traefik with no other configuration than your\nLet’s Encrypt account, and Traefik automatically negotiates\n(get/renew/configure) certificates for you — No extra step.\n\nCertificate Resolvers\nWe saw that you can configure a router to use TLS\n(--traefik.http.routers.router-name.tls=true). \nAs a consequence, we saw that Traefik would go through your certificate list to\nfind a suitable match for the domain at hand (and if not would use a default\ncertificate).\n\nFor automatic certificate generation, you can add a certificate resolver to your\nTLS options. A certificate resolver is responsible for retrieving certificates.\n\nHere, let’s define a certificate resolver that works with your Let’s Encrypt\naccount!\n\nservices:\n  traefik:\n    image: \"traefik:v2.0\"\n    command:\n      - --entrypoints.websecure.address=:443\n      # ...\n      - --certificatesresolvers.le.acme.email=my@email.com\n      - --certificatesresolvers.le.acme.storage=/acme.json\n      - --certificatesresolvers.le.acme.tlschallenge=true\n      # ...\n\nAs you can read, we defined a certificate resolver named le of type acme. Then,\nwe provided an email (your Let’s Encrypt account), the storage file (for\ncertificates it retrieves), and the challenge for certificate negotiation\n[https://docs.traefik.io/https/acme/#the-different-acme-challenges](here \ntlschallenge, just because it’s the most concise configuration option for the\nsake of the example).\n\nFrom now on, Traefik is fully equipped to generate certificates for you!\n\nUsing the Certificate Resolver\nIf you remember correctly (I’m sure you do!), we enabled TLS on our router like\nso:\n\nversion: \"3\"\n\nservices:\n  # ...\n  my-app:\n    image: containous/whoami:v1.3.0\n    labels:\n      - \"traefik.http.routers.my-app.rule=Host(`example.com`)\"\n      - \"traefik.http.routers.my-app.tls=true\"\n\nNow, to enable our certificate resolver and have it automatically generate\ncertificates (when needed), we’ll add it to the TLS configuration, like so:\n\nversion: \"3\"\n\nservices:\n  # ...\n  my-app:\n    image: containous/whoami:v1.3.0\n    labels:\n      - \"traefik.http.routers.my-app.rule=Host(`example.com`)\"\n      - \"traefik.http.routers.my-app.tls=true\"\n      - \"traefik.http.routers.my-app.tls.certresolver=le\"\n\nNow, if your certificate store doesn’t yet have a valid certificate for \nexample.com, the le certificate resolver will transparently negotiate one for\nyou — it’s that simple.\n\nMultiple Certificate Resolvers?\nWith certificate resolvers, you can configure different challenges.\n\nBelow is an example that shows how to configure two CertResolvers that leverage\nLet’s Encrypt, one using the dnsChallenge\n[https://docs.traefik.io/https/acme/#dnschallenge], the other using the \ntlsChallenge [https://docs.traefik.io/https/acme/#tlschallenge].\n\n[certificatesResolvers.resolver-digital-ocean.acme]\n  # ... \n  [certificatesResolvers.resolver-digital-ocean.acme.dnsChallenge]\n    provider = \"digitalocean\"\n    delayBeforeCheck = 0\n\n[certificatesResolvers.tls-challenge-resolver.acme]\n  # ...\n  [certificatesResolvers.tls-challenge-resolver.acme.tlsChallenge]\n\nLater on, you’ll be able to use one or the other on your routers.\n\n# in routers.toml\n\n[http.routers]\n  [http.routers.https-route]\n    rule = \"Host(`my.domain`)\"\n    [http.routers.https-route.tls]\n      certResolver = \"resolver-digital-ocean\"\n\n[http.routers.https-route-2]\n    rule = \"Host(`other.domain`)\"\n    [http.routers.https-route-2.tls]\n      certResolver = \"tls-challenge-resolver\"\n\nIn the above example (that uses the file provider), we’ve asked Traefik to\ngenerate certificates for my.domain using the dnsChallenge (with digital ocean)\nand to generate certificates for other.domain using the TLSChallenge.\n\nAnd you’ve guessed it already — Traefik supports DNS challenge for different DNS\nproviders, at the same time!\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWildcard and Let’s Encrypt?\nInstead of generating a certificate for each subdomain, you can choose to\ngenerate wildcard certificates!\n\n[http.routers]\n  [http.routers.router-example]\n    rule = \"Host(`something.my.domain`)\"\n    [http.routers.router-example.tls]\n      certResolver = \"my-resolver\"\n      [[http.routers.router-example.tls.domains]]\n        main = \"my.domain\"\n        sans = \"*.my.domain\"\n\nIn the above example, we’ve configured Traefik to generate a wildcard\ncertificate for *.my.domain.\n\nIf we had omitted the .tls.domains section, Traefik would have used the host\n(here something.my.domain) defined in the Host rule to generate a certificate.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat About TCP & TLS?\nIf you want to configure TLS with TCP, then good news: nothing changes, you’ll\nconfigure the same tls option, but this time on your tcp router.\n\nversion: \"3\"\n\nservices:\n  # ...\n  my-tcp-app:\n    image: containous/whoamitcp:v1.0.0\n    labels:\n      - \"traefik.tcp.routers.my-tcp-app.rule=HostSNI(`tcp-example.com`)\"\n      - \"traefik.tcp.routers.my-tcp-app.tls=true\"\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat About Pass-Through?\nSometimes your services handle TLS by themselves. In such cases, Traefik mustn’t\nterminate the TLS connection but forward the request “as is” to these services.\nTo configure this passthrough, you’ll need to configure a TCP router (even if\nyour service handles HTTPS).\n\nversion: \"3\"\n\nservices:\n  # ...\n  my-tcp-app:\n    image: containous/whoamitcp:v1.0.0\n    labels:\n      - \"traefik.tcp.routers.my-tcp-app.rule=HostSNI(`tcp-example.com`)\"\n      - \"traefik.tcp.routers.my-tcp-app.tls.passthrough=true\"\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestions? Where to Go Next?\nHopefully, this article sheds light on how to configure Traefik 2 with TLS.\n\nIf there are missing use cases or still unanswered questions, let me know in the\ncomments or on the community forum\n[https://community.containo.us/c/traefik/traefik-v2]!\n\nIn the meantime — Happy Traefik!","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p class=\"post-sub-title\">HTTPS (& TCP over TLS) for everyone!</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://containous.ghost.io/content/images/2019/11/image-103.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>There are hundreds of reasons why I love being a developer (besides memories of sleepless nights trying to fix a video game that nobody except myself would ever play).</p><p>Being a developer gives you superpowers — you can solve any kind of problems.

Hopefully, after having read this article, you’ll\nunderstand every concept there is to know, and you’ll keep learning by yourself,\ndiscovering tips & tricks to share with the community.\n\nBefore we go further, I’ll assume for this article that you already have a\ndocker setup using Traefik 2.0. Since I like to use docker-compose files for\nbasic demonstrations, I’ll use the following base compose file:\n\nversion: \"3.3\"\n\nservices:\n  traefik:\n    image: \"traefik:v2.0.0\"\n    command:\n      - --entrypoints.web.address=:80\n      - --providers.docker=true\n    ports:\n      - \"80:80\"\n      - \"8080:8080\"\n    volumes:\n      - \"/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro\"\n  \n  my-app:\n    image: containous/whoami:v1.3.0\n\nFull compose file available there.\n[https://github.com/containous/blog-posts/blob/master/2019_09_10-101_docker/docker-compose-01.yml]\nNothing fancy, we declare an entrypoint\n[https://docs.traefik.io/v2.0/routing/entrypoints/] (web for port 80), enable\nthe docker provider [https://docs.traefik.io/v2.0/providers/overview/], attach\nour traefik container to the needed ports and make sure we can listen to Docker\nthought the socket. We also have an application my-app we’ll expose later.\n\nSide Note: You can get the examples from our repository if you want to play with\nthem. (Yes, we know how dangerous it can be to copy/paste some YAML :-))\n\nNow that we’re all set, let’s start!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLet’s Enable the Dashboard!\nBecause we all enjoy seeing what we’re doing, we’ll first enable Traefik’s\nDashboard in development mode, and all we need to do is add one argument to the\nTraefik command itself.\n\nservices:\n  traefik:\n    image: \"traefik:v2.0.0\"\n    command:\n      - --entrypoints.web.address=:80\n      - --providers.docker\n      - --api.insecure # Don't do that in production\n#   ...\n\nFull compose file available there.\n[https://github.com/containous/blog-posts/blob/master/2019_09_10-101_docker/docker-compose-02.yml]\nThere we are! By adding --api.insecure we’ve enabled the API along with the\ndashboard. But beware, in this first step, we’ve enabled the insecure\ndevelopment mode — Don’t do that in production!\n\nOf course, we’ll see at the end of the article how to enable a secured\ndashboard, but for now, you can enjoy and see it on localhost:8080/dashboard/\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy Application Handles Requests on \"example.com\"\nIf you only need to route requests to my-app based on the host, then attach one \nlabel to your container — That’s it!\n\nservices:\n  my-app:\n    image: containous/whoami:v1.3.0\n    labels:\n      - traefik.http.routers.my-app.rule=Host(`example.com`)\n\nFull compose file available there.\n[https://github.com/containous/blog-posts/blob/master/2019_09_10-101_docker/docker-compose-03.yml]\nQuick Explanation\nIn English, this label means, “Hey Traefik! (traefik.) This HTTP router (\nhttp.routers.) I call my-app (my-app.) must catch requests to example.com (\nrule=Host(`example.com`)).”\n\nMore Details (Optional Read)\nTraefik 2.0 introduces the notion of Routers\n[https://docs.traefik.io/v2.0/routing/routers/]. Routers define the routes that\nconnect your services to the requests, and you use rules\n[https://docs.traefik.io/v2.0/routing/routers/#rule] to define what makes the\nconnection. This is the reason why you see routers in the label, as well as rule\n.\n\nTraefik 2.0 also introduces TCP support (in addition to the existing HTTP\nsupport). Since Traefik supports both protocols, it wants to know what kind of\nprotocol you’re interested in, which explains the http keyword in the label.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy Application Listens on a Specific Port\nWhat happens if your application listens on a different port than the default \n:80? Let’s say it listens on :8082. We’ll build on the previous example and add\n(again) one label.\n\nservices:\n  my-service:\n    image: containous/whoami:v1.3.0\n    command:\n      - --port=8082 # Our service listens on 8082\n    labels:\n      - traefik.http.routers.my-app.rule=Host(`example.com`)\n      - traefik.http.services.my-app.loadbalancer.server.port=8082\n\nFull compose file available there.\n[https://github.com/containous/blog-posts/blob/master/2019_09_10-101_docker/docker-compose-04.yml]\nQuick Explanation\nIn English, this label means, “Hey Traefik! (traefik.) This HTTP service (\nhttp.services.) I call my-app (my-app.) will load balance incoming requests\nbetween servers (.server) that listen on port 8082 (.port=8082).”\n\nMore Details (Optional Read)\nTraefik 2.0 introduces the notion of Services\n[https://docs.traefik.io/v2.0/routing/services/]. Services are the targets for\nthe routes. They usually define how to reach your programs in your cluster.\nServices can have different types. The most common one is the LoadBalancer\n[https://docs.traefik.io/v2.0/routing/services/#servers-load-balancer] type. The\nLoadBalancer type is a round robin between all the available instances (called \nserver). By default, Traefik considers that your program is available on the\nport exposed by the Dockerfile of your program, but you can change that by\nexplicitly defining the port.\n\nSince we specify only one service in the example, there is no need to define the\ntarget of the previously defined router explicitly.\n\nSide Note: The—-port=8082 command is specific to our whoami application and has\nnothing to do with Traefik. It tells whoami to start listening on 8082, so we\ncan simulate our use case.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI Need BasicAuth (Or Any Piece of Middleware)\nOnce Traefik has found a match for the request, it can process it before\nforwarding it to the service. In the following example, we’ll add a BasicAuth\nmechanism for our route. This is done with two additional labels.\n\nservices:\n  my-svc:\n    image: containous/whoami:v1.3.0\n    labels:\n      - traefik.http.routers.my-app.rule=Host(`example.com`)\n      - traefik.http.routers.my-app.middlewares=auth\n      - traefik.http.middlewares.auth.basicauth.users=test:xxx\n\nFull compose file available there.\n[https://github.com/containous/blog-posts/blob/master/2019_09_10-101_docker/docker-compose-05.yml]\nQuick Explanation\nIn English, the first label means, “Hey Traefik! (traefik.) My HTTP router I\ncalled my-app, remember? (http.routers.my-app.) I’d like to attach to it a piece\nof middleware named auth (.middlewares=auth).”\n\nOf course, since we haven’t yet declared the auth middleware, we need to be a\nbit more explicit, so the second label means, “Hey Traefik! (traefik.) Let’s\ntalk about an HTTP middleware (http.middlewares.) I call auth (auth.). It’s a\nBasicAuth middleware (basicauth.). Since you probably need users to know who can\ndo what, here is the users list (.users=test:xxx).”\n\nMore Details (Optional Read)\nTraefik 2.0 introduces the notion of Middleware\n[https://docs.traefik.io/v2.0/middlewares/overview/]. Middleware is a way to\ndefine behaviors and tweak the incoming request before forwarding it to the\nservice. Since they act before the request is forwarded, they are attached to\nRouters. You can define middleware and reuse them as many times as you like\n(this is why you need to name them, in the example auth). There are many kinds\nof middleware, and BasicAuth\n[https://docs.traefik.io/v2.0/middlewares/basicauth/] is one of them. Each\nmiddleware has a different set of parameters to define their behaviors (in the\nexample, we define the users list).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI Need HTTPS\nWith Traefik, enabling automatic certificate generation is a matter of 4 lines\nof configuration, and enabling HTTPS on your routes is a matter of 2 lines of\nconfiguration.\n\n1 — Enabling Automatic Certificate Generation\n\nWe’ll introduce a little tip here — Since Traefik is launched as a container,\nwe’ll attach labels to it for common configuration options. (What is specific to\nother containers will, of course, stay on other containers, we’re not messy\npeople!)\n\nservices:\n  traefik:\n    image: \"traefik:v2.0.0\"\n    command:\n      - --entrypoints.websecure.address=:443\n      # ...\n      - --certificatesresolvers.le.acme.email=my@email.com\n      - --certificatesresolvers.le.acme.storage=/acme.json\n      - --certificatesresolvers.le.acme.tlschallenge=true\n      # ...\n    ports:\n      # ...\n      - \"443:443\"\n\nFull compose file available there.\n[https://github.com/containous/blog-posts/blob/master/2019_09_10-101_docker/docker-compose-06.yml]\nQuick Explanation\nWe’ve seen already the first command line given to Traefik. In English, it\nmeans, “I have an entrypoint (entrypoints.) I call websecure (websecure.) that\nuses port 443 (.address=:443).” And since Traefik now listens to 443, we need to\ntell Docker that it should bind external port 443 to our service’s port 443 (\n\"443:443\").\n\nNow, the others are a bit trickier, but nothing crazy if you’ve had time to\ndrink your coffee/tea. The first says, “I’d like a mechanism to generate\ncertificates for me (certificatesresolvers.) that I’ll call le (le.). It’s an\nacme resolver (acme.), my account there is my@email.com (email=my@email.com).”\n(Disclaimer: not my real email address, don’t try it.)\n\nThe second says, “This mechanism named le I told you about, the acme stuff (\ncertificatesresolvers.le.acme.), it will save the certificates in the file \n/acme.json (storage=/acme.json).”\n\nAnd the third is our inner geek speaking, “Since this le mechanism I defined\nbefore (certificatesresolvers.le.acme.) supports different challenges for\ncertificate generation, I’ll choose … the TLS challenge (tlschallenge=true).”\n\nThat was a bit more text than usual, but here we are: we have a fully functional\nmechanism to generate/renew certificates for us!\n\nMore Details (Optional Read)\nTraefik 2.0 introduces the notion of CertificatesResolvers\n[https://docs.traefik.io/v2.0/https/acme/]. Certificates resolvers are a system\nthat handles certificate generation/renewal/disposal for you. They detect the\nhosts you’ve defined for your routers and get the matching certificates.\n\nCurrently, certificates resolvers leverage Let’s Encrypt\n[https://letsencrypt.org/] to get certificates, and expect you to configure your\naccount (which is basically your email address). In order to prove Let’s Encrypt\nthat you’re the owner of the domains you’ll request certificates for, LE will\ngive Traefik a challenge. There are multiple possible challenges, and we chose\nin the example the TLSChallenge. In the documentation, you’ll find a description\nfor each other challenges\n[https://docs.traefik.io/v2.0/https/acme/#the-different-acme-challenges] (\ndnsChallenge [https://docs.traefik.io/v2.0/https/acme/#dnschallenge] and \nhttpChallenge [https://docs.traefik.io/v2.0/https/acme/#httpchallenge]).\n\nKnow that advanced users can define multiple CertificatesResolvers using\ndifferent challenges, and that they can use them to generate wildcards … but\nthat’s a story we’ll talk about later :-)\n\n2 — Enabling Automatic Certificate Generation\n\nNow that we have a mechanism to generate certificates for us, let’s leverage it\nto enable HTTPS on our route. We’ll only need two labels!\n\nmy-app:\n    image: containous/whoami:v1.3.0\n    labels:\n      - traefik.http.routers.my-app.rule=Host(`example.com`)\n      - traefik.http.routers.my-app.middlewares=auth\n      - traefik.http.routers.my-app.tls.certresolver=le\n      - traefik.http.routers.my-app.entrypoints=websecure\n\nFull compose file available there.\n[https://github.com/containous/blog-posts/blob/master/2019_09_10-101_docker/docker-compose-06.yml]\nQuick Explanation\nIn English, the first label means, “Hey Traefik! (traefik.) My HTTP router (\nhttp.routers.) I call my-app (my-app.) uses TLS and the CertificateResolver\nnamed le (certresolver=le).”\n\nAnd the second says, “Traefik! (traefik.) this router, you know? (\nhttp.routers.my-app) It will only listen to the entrypoint I call websecure (\nentrypoints=websecure).”\n\nMore Details (Optional Read)\nTraefik 2.0 allows you to define TLS termination directly on your routers\n[https://docs.traefik.io/v2.0/routing/routers/#tls]!\n\nAlso, by default, routers listen to every known entrypoints. In our example, we\nwanted Traefik to limit the use of https on port 443, which is the reason why we\ntold the router to listen only to websecure (defined to port 443 with \nentrypoints.websecure.address=:443)\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI Want HTTPS Redirection!\nNow that we have HTTPS routes, let’s redirect every non-https requests to their\nhttps equivalent. For that, we’ll reuse the previous trick and add just 4 labels \nto declare a redirect middleware and a catch-all router for unsecured routes.\n\nservices:\n  traefik:\n    image: \"traefik:v2.0.0\"\n    # ...\n    labels:\n      # ...\n      \n      # middleware redirect\n      - \"traefik.http.middlewares.redirect-to-https.redirectscheme.scheme=https\"\n      \n      # global redirect to https\n      - \"traefik.http.routers.redirs.rule=hostregexp(`{host:.+}`)\"\n      - \"traefik.http.routers.redirs.entrypoints=web\"\n      - \"traefik.http.routers.redirs.middlewares=redirect-to-https\"\n\nFull compose file available there.\n[https://github.com/containous/blog-posts/blob/master/2019_09_10-101_docker/docker-compose-07.yml]\nQuick Explanation\nIn English, the first label means, “Hey Traefik! (traefik.) let’s declare an\nHTTP middleware (http.middlewares.) we’ll call redirect-to-https (\nredirect-to-https.). It’s a RedirectScheme\n[https://docs.traefik.io/v2.0/middlewares/redirectscheme/] middleware (\nredirectscheme.) that will force the scheme to https (scheme=https).”\n\nThen, let’s see the router part, “Hey Traefik!

This is the reason why you see <code>routers</code> in the label, as well as <code>rule</code>.</p><p>Traefik 2.0 also introduces TCP support (in addition to the existing HTTP support).

Services are the <em><em>targets</em></em> for the routes. They usually define how to reach your programs in your cluster. Services can have different types. The most common one is the <a href=\"https://docs.traefik.io/v2.0/routing/services/#servers-load-balancer\" rel=\"noopener\">LoadBalancer</a> type. The LoadBalancer type is a round robin between all the available instances (called <code>server</code>). By default, Traefik considers that your program is available on the port exposed by the Dockerfile of your program, but you can change that by explicitly defining the port.</p><p>Since we specify only one service in the example, there is no need to define the target of the previously defined router explicitly.</p><p>Side Note: The<code>—-port=8082</code> command is specific to our <code>whoami</code> application and has nothing to do with Traefik.

Middleware is a way to define behaviors and tweak the incoming request before forwarding it to the service. Since they act before the request is forwarded, they are attached to Routers. You can define middleware and reuse them as many times as you like (this is why you need to name them, in the example <code>auth</code>). There are many kinds of middleware, and <a href=\"https://docs.traefik.io/v2.0/middlewares/basicauth/\" rel=\"noopener\">BasicAuth</a> is one of them.

In English, it means, “I have an entrypoint (<code>entrypoints.</code>) I call websecure (<code>websecure.</code>) that uses port 443 (<code>.address=:443</code>).” And since Traefik now listens to 443, we need to tell Docker that it should bind external port 443 to our service’s port 443 (<code>\"443:443\"</code>).</p><p>Now, the others are a bit trickier, but nothing crazy if you’ve had time to drink your coffee/tea.

They detect the hosts you’ve defined for your routers and get the matching certificates.</p><p>Currently, certificates resolvers leverage <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">Let’s Encrypt</a> to get certificates, and expect you to configure your account (which is basically your email address). In order to prove Let’s Encrypt that you’re the owner of the domains you’ll request certificates for, LE will give Traefik a challenge. There are multiple possible challenges, and we chose in the example the TLSChallenge.

Make sure you grab your cup\nof coffee/cup of tea before going further because this is probably the biggest\nnew features list we’ve ever had to write!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTCP Support with SNI Routing & Multi-Protocol Ports\nWe talked about this flagship feature in the 2.0 alpha announcement\n[/blog/back-to-traefik-2-0-2f9aa17be305/], but since it was feature request #10\n[https://github.com/containous/traefik/issues/10], we thought we would dedicate\nsome time to discussing this key element in a world of new possibilities.\n\nLet’s see a sample configuration — using the newly supported YAML format — that\nroutes requests to a database:\n\ntcp:\n  routers:\n    to-database:\n      entrypoints:\n      - database-entrypoint\n      rule: HostSNI(`*`)\n      service: database-service\n  services:     \n    database-service:\n      loadBalancer:\n        servers:\n        - address: xx.xx.xx.xx:xx\n\nIn the example above, every request ending on database-entrypoint will be routed\nto our database-service.\n\n> Over TLS, Traefik routes TCP \nrequests based on the SNI\nIn the following example, Traefik [/traefik/] routes requests to two databases\nbased on the SNI (Server Name Indication):\n\ntcp:\n  routers:\n    to-db-1:\n      entrypoints:\n      - web-secure\n      rule: \"HostSNI(`db1.domain`)\"\n      service: \"db1\"\n      tls: {} \n    to-db-2:\n      entrypoints:\n      - web-secure\n      rule: \"HostSNI(`db2.domain`)\"\n      service: \"db2\"\n      tls: {}\n\n> HTTP & TCP on the same port?\nYes, there is Traefik for that!\nIf you ever want to have the same entrypoint get both HTTP and TCP requests,\nknow that Traefik will handle it perfectly!\n\ntcp:\n  routers:\n    to-db-1:\n      entrypoints:\n      - web-secure\n      rule: \"HostSNI(`db1.domain`)\"\n      service: \"db-1\"\n      tls: {}\nhttp:\n  routers:\n    to-db1-dashboard:\n      entrypoints:\n      - web-secure\n      rule: \"Host(`dashboard.db1.domain`)\"\n      service: \"db1-dashboard\"\n      tls: {}\n\nIn the above example, HTTP requests on dashboard.db1.domain will be routed to\nthe database dashboard service, and TCP requests on db1.domain will be routed to\nthe database.\n\nFully Customize Your Routes with Middleware\nTraefik 2.0 introduces middleware\n[https://docs.traefik.io/middlewares/overview/]: a common banner for features\nthat tweak requests before/after routing them to their destinations.\n\n> You can declare Middleware and reuse them on as \nmany routers as you like.\nWant to see how to configure them? Let’s declare a BasicAuth middleware\n[https://docs.traefik.io/middlewares/basicauth/] to control access to our\nservice! (this time using TOML)\n\n# Declaring a basicauth middleware with two users\n[http.middlewares.test-auth.basicAuth]\n  users = [\"user1:hashed\", \"user2:hashed\"]\n\n# Applying the middleware to our router\n[http.routers.my-router.to-service]\n  rule = \"host(`my-protected.domain`)\"\n  middlewares = [\"test-auth\"]\n  service = \"service1\"\n\n> A Chain to Bind Them All\nIf you have a classic combination you often use together, you can declare chains\n[https://docs.traefik.io/middlewares/chain/], and reuse them over and over.\nWhat’s even better for our Kubernetes users, you can use Traefik’s new CRD\n(Custom Resource Definition) for a crystal clear configuration that doesn’t\ninvolve intricate annotations. (You can find more information on the \nIngressRoute object\n[https://docs.traefik.io/providers/kubernetes-crd/#traefik-ingressroute-definition] \nin our documentation.)\n\napiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1\nkind: IngressRoute\nmetadata:\n  name: test\n  namespace: default\nspec:\n  entryPoints:\n    - web\n  routes:\n    - match: Host(`mydomain`)\n      kind: Rule\n      services:\n        - name: whoami\n          port: 80\n      middlewares:\n        - name: secured\n---\napiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1\nkind: Middleware\nmetadata:\n  name: secured\nspec:\n  chain:\n    middlewares:\n    - name: https-only\n    - name: known-ips\n    - name: auth-users\n---\napiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1\nkind: Middleware\nmetadata:\n  name: auth-users\nspec:\n  basicAuth:\n    secret: secretUsers #yes!

We also wanted to display what features they can enable.\n\nSince the flow has changed, we wanted to display every path that leads to\nservices, with every configuration option.\n\nCanary Deployments with Service Load Balancers\nAnother long-awaited feature [https://github.com/containous/traefik/issues/1164] \n— canary deployments, A/B testing — makes its way into Traefik 2.0 in the form\nof Service Load Balancers.\n\nService Load Balancers can be seen as virtual services that are responsible for\nforwarding the request to the actual services.\n\nLet’s take a classic scenario where you have an existing route to an API:\n\nhttp:\n  routers:\n    my-route:\n      rule: \"Host(`my.domain`)\"\n      service: my-api-v1\n  services:\n    my-api-v1:\n      loadBalancer:\n        servers:\n        - url: \"http://private-ip-server-1/\"\n\nNow you want to deploy a new version of this service, but would like to deploy\nit progressively, let’s say approximately a third of the requests. What you’ll\ndo is deploy the new service, with its own ID (here it’smy-api-v2).\n\nhttp:\n  services:\n    my-api-v2:\n      loadBalancer:\n        servers:\n        - url: \"http://private-ip-server-2/\"\n\nThen, instead of pointing directly to this new version, you’ll first define a\nService Load Balancer (in the example canary-api) and define the proportion for\neach version (with the weight option).\n\nhttp:\n  services:\n    canary-api:\n      weighted:\n        services:\n        - name: my-api-v1\n          weight: 3\n        - name: my-api-v2\n          weight: 1\n\nFinally, point to this canary-api service from your router.\n\nhttp:\n  routers:\n    my-route:\n      rule: \"Host(`my.domain`)\"\n      service: canary-api\n\nLater, you’ll be able to update the weight without having to redeploy your \nactual services. You’ll also be able to scale them without any impact on the\ncanary deployment itself.\n\nMirroring with Service Load Balancers\nCanary deployments aren’t the only tricks available in the service family.\nTraefik 2.0 introduces Mirroring Services — a way to duplicate the incoming\nrequest [https://github.com/containous/traefik/issues/2989] and send it to\ndifferent services at the same time. The mirror will get a given percentage of\nrequests, and its answers will be ignored.\n\n[http.services.mirrored-api]\n    [http.services.mirrored-api.mirroring]\n      service = \"api\"\n    [[http.services.mirrored-api.mirroring.mirrors]]\n      name = \"api-v2\"\n      percent = 10\n\n[http.services.api]\n    [http.services.api.loadBalancer]\n      [[http.services.api.loadBalancer.servers]]\n        url = \"http://private-ip-server-1/\"\n\n[http.services.api-v2]\n    [http.services.api-v2.loadBalancer]\n      [[http.services.api-v2.loadBalancer.servers]]\n        url = \"http://private-ip-server-2/\"\n\nIn the above example, we’re sending 10% of the requests to the mirror.\n\nAnd Much, Much More!\nTraefik 2.0 introduces a syntax (@provider) to allow users to declare elements\n(middleware, services, routers) in a provider and to reference them from an\nother one. It provides an easier way to configure CORS headers\n[https://docs.traefik.io/middlewares/headers/#cors-headers], embeds a redesigned \nconstraint management\n[https://docs.traefik.io/providers/overview/#restrict-the-scope-of-service-discovery] \nto better control services you want to expose, and improves the default rule\ngeneration for a quick and easy way to define routes for containers.\n\nOn top of many enhancements [https://docs.traefik.io/operations/api/], the API\nnow embeds status information for your middleware, services, routers, and\nreports errors to help you identify and fix problems.\n\nThe polished configuration options ensure that configuring Traefik is always\nachieved the same way whether expressed with TOML, YAML, labels, or keys, and\nthe revamped documentation [https://docs.traefik.io/] includes examples for\nevery syntax.\n\nYou can define TLS termination separately on each router, configure TLS\npassthrough, use the new CertResolver to benefit from different challenges for\ncertificate generation (yes, it’s now multiple-DNS-providers-proof!), and\ndynamically generate wildcard certificates.\n\nRouter rules now use a go-like syntax with operators and parenthesis\n[https://docs.traefik.io/routing/routers/#rule] for powerful and readable\ncombinations.\n\nThe list goes on and on with bug fixes and other significant tweaks!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMigrating From 1.x\nWith so many new features, bug fixes, and enhancements, Traefik 2.0 might ask\nyou to re-think the way you used to route your requests. In order to facilitate\nthe transition and help you leverage the power of these new options, we\ninitiated a migration guide [https://docs.traefik.io/migration/v1-to-v2/] that\ngoes through every change we made.\n\nFor our Kubernetes [https://kubernetes.io/] user-base, we’ve also written a \nmigration tool [https://github.com/containous/traefik-migration-tool] to help\nyou convert your Ingress objects to the new IngressRoute format. (This migration\ntool will also help all users convert their acme.json file.)\n\nAll this is designed for the thousands of people already using Traefik.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBehind the Curtain\nTraefik 2.0 is not the only thing that has improved! By the time we released\n2.0, we launched TraefikEE [/traefikee/], Yaegi\n[https://github.com/containous/yaegi], Maesh [/maesh/], and you can bet we’ll\nkeep going further. We also constantly monitor our processes and tools. We’ve\nlaunched a Community Forum [https://community.containo.us/] to foster better\ncommunication amongst users, introduced a monthly journal, and scheduled \nTraefik\nOnline Meetups [/events/] to promote the community talent.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext Steps\nMore than anything, this release shows the importance of the community. Every\n[https://github.com/containous/traefik/issues/10] feature\n[https://github.com/containous/traefik/issues/2999] that\n[https://github.com/containous/traefik/issues/7] has\n[https://github.com/containous/traefik/issues/727] been\n[https://github.com/containous/traefik/issues/895] discussed\n[https://github.com/containous/traefik/issues/1164] today\n[https://github.com/containous/traefik/issues/160] was born\n[https://github.com/containous/traefik/issues/2989] from\n[https://github.com/containous/traefik/issues/914] a\n[https://github.com/containous/traefik/issues/2653] user\n[https://github.com/containous/traefik/issues/966] asking for a new feature\n[https://github.com/containous/traefik/issues/3378], reporting a bug\n[https://github.com/containous/traefik/issues/4069], or just asking\n[https://github.com/containous/traefik/issues/3868] for “better.”\n[https://github.com/containous/traefik/issues/2773]\n\nTraefik 1.X has been downloaded more than a billion times, and we hope to double\nthat number with Traefik 2.X.\n\n> ❤️ Thank you for your support!❤️\n… and keep raising your voice for the (many) version(s) to come!\n\nP.S. — Stay tuned!

What you’ll do is deploy the new service, with its own ID (here it’s<code>my-api-v2</code>).</p><pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">http:\n  services:\n    my-api-v2:\n      loadBalancer:\n        servers:\n        - url: \"http://private-ip-server-2/\"</code></pre><p>Then, instead of pointing directly to this new version, you’ll first define a Service Load Balancer (in the example <code>canary-api</code>) and define the proportion for each version (with the <code>weight</code> option).</p><pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">http:\n  services:\n    canary-api:\n      weighted:\n        services:\n        - name: my-api-v1\n          weight: 3\n        - name: my-api-v2\n          weight: 1</code></pre><p>Finally, point to this <code>canary-api</code> service from your router.</p><pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">http:\n  routers:\n    my-route:\n      rule: \"Host(`my.domain`)\"\n      service: canary-api</code></pre><p>Later, you’ll be able to update the weight without having to redeploy your <em><em>actual</em></em> services.

Traefik 2.0 introduces Mirroring Services — a way to <a href=\"https://github.com/containous/traefik/issues/2989\" rel=\"noopener\">duplicate the incoming request</a> and send it to different services at the same time. The mirror will get a given percentage of requests, and its answers will be ignored.</p><pre><code class=\"language-toml\">[http.services.mirrored-api]\n    [http.services.mirrored-api.mirroring]\n      service = \"api\"\n    [[http.services.mirrored-api.mirroring.mirrors]]\n      name = \"api-v2\"\n      percent = 10\n\n[http.services.api]\n    [http.services.api.loadBalancer]\n      [[http.services.api.loadBalancer.servers]]\n        url = \"http://private-ip-server-1/\"\n\n[http.services.api-v2]\n    [http.services.api-v2.loadBalancer]\n      [[http.services.api-v2.loadBalancer.servers]]\n        url = \"http://private-ip-server-2/\"</code></pre><p>In the above example, we’re sending 10% of the requests to the mirror.</p><h2 id=\"and-much-much-more-\">And Much, Much More!</h2><p>Traefik 2.0 introduces a syntax (<code>@provider</code>) to allow users to declare elements (middleware, services, routers) in a provider and to reference them from an other one. It provides an easier way to configure <a href=\"https://docs.traefik.io/middlewares/headers/#cors-headers\">CORS headers</a>, embeds a redesigned <a href=\"https://docs.traefik.io/providers/overview/#restrict-the-scope-of-service-discovery\">constraint management</a> to better control services you want to expose, and improves the default rule generation for a quick and easy way to define routes for containers.</p><p>On top of <a href=\"https://docs.traefik.io/operations/api/\">many enhancements</a>, the API now embeds status information for your middleware, services, routers, and reports errors to help you identify and fix problems.</p><p>The polished configuration options ensure that configuring Traefik is always achieved the same way whether expressed with TOML, YAML, labels, or keys, and the <a href=\"https://docs.traefik.io/\">revamped documentation</a> includes examples for every syntax.</p><p>You can define TLS termination separately on each router, configure TLS passthrough, use the new <code>CertResolver</code> to benefit from different challenges for certificate generation (yes, it’s now multiple-DNS-providers-proof!), and dynamically generate wildcard certificates.</p><p>Router rules now use a go-like syntax with <a href=\"https://docs.traefik.io/routing/routers/#rule\">operators and parenthesis</a> for powerful and readable combinations.</p><p>The list goes on and on with bug fixes and other significant tweaks!</p><hr><h2 id=\"migrating-from-1-x\">Migrating From 1.x</h2><p>With so many new features, bug fixes, and enhancements, Traefik 2.0 might ask you to re-think the way you used to route your requests. In order to facilitate the transition and help you leverage the power of these new options, we initiated a <a href=\"https://docs.traefik.io/migration/v1-to-v2/\" rel=\"noopener\">migration guide</a> that goes through every change we made.</p><p>For our <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/\" rel=\"noopener\">Kubernetes</a> user-base, we’ve also written a <a href=\"https://github.com/containous/traefik-migration-tool\" rel=\"noopener\">migration tool</a> to help you convert your Ingress objects to the new IngressRoute format. (This migration tool will also help all users convert their <code>acme.json</code> file.)</p><p>All this is designed for the thousands of people already using Traefik.</p><hr><h2 id=\"behind-the-curtain\">Behind the Curtain</h2><p>Traefik 2.0 is not the only thing that has improved!

So the blunt answer could also be, “We\npronounce Traefik the best we can.”\n\nSo many languages …\nSo no, this ligature in Traefik has nothing to do with the etymology of the\nword. This ligature is the result of the very question, “How do you pronounce\nTraefik?”\n\nTo answer this question, we’ll use the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and\nwill write:\n\n> You pronounce Traefik like the regular word Traffic\n[https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/traffic] (/ˈtræfɪk/)\nWhile designing the logo, we’ve just been sloppy and got rid of the stress ˈ and\nsince French people are not able to make a proper ɪ sound, we replaced it with\nan i.\n\nNow you know!\nEven though the official answer is out, we still hope to see many Traefik users\napproaching us and asking us the same question over and over again, “How do you\npronounce Traefik?” simply because it’s the only thing they haven’t figured out\nfrom the documentation.","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p class=\"post-sub-title\">The Answer Lies in the Question</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"https://containous.ghost.io/content/images/2019/11/image-116.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>If you’re here reading (at last!) the official answer to the infamous question, “How do you pronounce Traefik?”, then chances are you’re a Traefik user who has had passionate debates with your colleagues around this weird looking character <code>æ</code> which shares the lines between an <code>a</code> and an <code>e</code>.

Because, even though we often\ntalk to the community In Real Life, we were unfamiliar with the \nwe-don’t-see-you-while-we-talk format of the online Meetup. And, here is another\nanswer to a question you didn’t ask, but, again, we’ll answer — Yes, we enjoyed\nthis moment with you, and would do it again.\n\nChances are you’re here for the video only, and not the story behind the movie,\nso let’s proceed!\n\nThe slides are available here\n[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vS3_WzHd4vOA7pqzFL1YTIom-_t9OrvmKwV3_GuBvqQeWV1jfxFml18M2miCpinL2PP-od5kv1NaN-m/pub?start=false&loop=true&delayms=3000]\n, and code for the demos is available on Github\n[https://github.com/containous/slides/tree/online-meetup-v2/demo/v2-tcp].“Q&A\nTime (Excerpts)”\nAbout TCP (and UDP)\n> Can the TCP entry point use Let’s Encrypt [https://letsencrypt.org/]? Could you\nhave HTTP and TCP endpoints using the same hostname? Is it ready for UDP?\nWe loved bringing TCP support to Traefik [/traefik/], and we wanted it to come\nalong with features our users would expect — one of them being Let’s Encrypt\nsupport (so yes, TCP in Traefik supports Let’s Encrypt for automatic\ncertificates, like with HTTP).\n\nWe also wanted Traefik to be able to route TCP and HTTP requests\n[/blog/the-journey-to-traefik-enterprise-edition-https-for-everyone-90a36b33600/] \non the same entry points, which was quite a challenge. This was made possible\nwith a simple trick — the use of the SNI in TLS connections. But this comes with\na limitation: you won’t be able to route both HTTP and TCP requests on the same \nhost+port combination. If for the same domain you’d like to route TCP and HTTP\nrequests, we encourage you to use two different ports.\n\nTCP was made possible by the re-architectured core. This new core also enables\nus to bring UDP support, and even if it is not written yet, it’s a matter of\nweeks before it’s out.\n\nAbout Middleware\n> Do middleware always applied from left to right? Can a service be a middleware\nCan custom middlewares be created? Can we use middlewares on TCP endpoints? Can\nwe use middleware on the response? Is middleware for ingress only?\nSo middleware [https://docs.traefik.io/middlewares/overview/] is a concept we\nintroduced to enable you to fine-tune the life cycle of the requests. They will\noften act before the request is forwarded to the services\n[https://docs.traefik.io/routing/services/], and can also operate on the\nresponse you get from the services (like the headers\n[https://docs.traefik.io/middlewares/headers/] middleware does). Pieces of\nmiddleware are applied from left to right on the request, and from right to left\non the response. Since you define the order, and since you can define as many \nchains [https://docs.traefik.io/middlewares/chain/] or attach as many pieces of\nmiddleware to your routers [https://docs.traefik.io/routing/routers/] as you\nwant, you have total control. There are currently no available middleware for\nTCP routers, but it’s something we’re looking into (if you have ideas, let us\nknow!). And regarding custom middleware, even though we know our user base is\nlooking for it, it won’t fit in the 2.0 scope (which is already big!).\n\nAbout KV Stores & Distributed Let’s Encrypt\n> Current (pre-2.0) traefik can store ACME certificates in a file or a KV store.\nThe latter helps with running a cluster of traefik, but the storage is\nrestricted to 512kb of certificate information when using Consul. Will this\nimprove? (storing in a key per certificate instead of a single key for all, for\nexample)\nWhile working on 2.0, we decided it was time to rework this part. Sticking with\nthe Unix Philosophy, “Make each program do one thing well,” Traefik is getting\nback to be a good old single-instance pure data plane. At the same time,\nclustering has been redesigned from scratch using a production-proven rock-solid\nraft-based implementation, shipped with Traefik Enterprise Edition (see how\n[/blog/the-journey-to-traefik-enterprise-edition-https-for-everyone-90a36b33600/]\n). Distributed features (like Let’s Encrypt) can now rely on this advanced\ncluster technology for these use cases. But hey! You can still use multiple\nTraefik instances with your favorite KV store, we only removed the unstable and\nexperimental part :)\n\nAbout the Final Release\n> When will the final 2.0 be available?\nShort answer: When it’s ready!\n\nReal answer: We wish we could tell. Even though we can estimate how much time we\nwill need to develop the missing features\n[https://github.com/containous/traefik/projects/3], we don’t know fore sure how\nmuch feedback you’ll provide, or how many features contributors will be tackling\n(and, as Damien pointed out — we’re ready to help any [new/returning/existing]\ncontributors eager to participate in the project!). Anyways, all we can say is,\n“stay tuned for updates!”\n\nAbout Other Things…\nYou’ll find other (more specific) questions (and answers) here\n[https://gist.github.com/dduportal/13874113cf5fa1d0901655e3367c31e5]!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDon’t Miss the Next Meet-Ups!\nIf you enjoyed the meet-up and would like to be notified of upcoming online\nevents and receive the videos from our previous sessions, sign up here\n[http://eepurl.com/gfN5Aj]!","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p class=\"post-sub-title\">Now Available on YouTube!</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"https://containous.ghost.io/content/images/2019/12/image-5.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>What a week, everyone!

And, here is another answer to a question you didn’t ask, but, again, we’ll answer — Yes, we enjoyed this moment with you, and would do it again.</p><p>Chances are you’re here for the video only, and <em><em>not</em></em> the story behind the movie, so let’s proceed!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption\"><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s8qYWPC6YdI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><figcaption>The slides are <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vS3_WzHd4vOA7pqzFL1YTIom-_t9OrvmKwV3_GuBvqQeWV1jfxFml18M2miCpinL2PP-od5kv1NaN-m/pub?start=false&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000\" rel=\"noopener\">available here</a>, and code for the demos is available <a href=\"https://github.com/containous/slides/tree/online-meetup-v2/demo/v2-tcp\" rel=\"noopener\">on Github</a>.</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"-qa-time-excerpts-\">“Q&amp;A Time (Excerpts)”</h2><h3 id=\"about-tcp-and-udp-\">About TCP (and UDP)</h3><blockquote><em><em>Can the TCP entry point use <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">Let’s Encrypt</a>? Could you have HTTP and TCP endpoints using the same hostname? Is it ready for UDP?</em></em></blockquote><p>We loved bringing TCP support to <a href=\"https://containous.ghost.io/traefik/\">Traefik</a>, and we wanted it to come along with features our users would expect — one of them being Let’s Encrypt support (so yes, TCP in Traefik supports Let’s Encrypt for automatic certificates, like with HTTP).</p><p>We also wanted Traefik to be able to route TCP and <a href=\"https://containous.ghost.io/blog/the-journey-to-traefik-enterprise-edition-https-for-everyone-90a36b33600/\">HTTP requests</a> on the same entry points, which was quite a challenge. This was made possible with a simple trick — the use of the SNI in TLS connections. But this comes with a limitation: you won’t be able to route both HTTP and TCP requests on the <em><em>same</em></em> <code>host+port</code> combination. If for the <em><em>same domain</em></em> you’d like to route TCP and HTTP requests, we encourage you to use two different ports.</p><p>TCP was made possible by the re-architectured core. This new core also enables us to bring UDP support, and even if it is not written yet, it’s a matter of weeks before it’s out.</p><h3 id=\"about-middleware\">About Middleware</h3><blockquote><em><em>Do middleware always applied from left to right? Can a service be a middleware Can custom middlewares be created? Can we use middlewares on TCP endpoints? Can we use middleware on the response? Is middleware for ingress only?</em></em></blockquote><p>So <a href=\"https://docs.traefik.io/middlewares/overview/\">middleware</a> is a concept we introduced to enable you to fine-tune the life cycle of the requests. They will often act <em><em>before</em></em> the request is forwarded to the <a href=\"https://docs.traefik.io/routing/services/\">services</a>, and can also operate on the response you get from the services (like the <a href=\"https://docs.traefik.io/middlewares/headers/\">headers</a> middleware does). Pieces of middleware are applied from left to right on the request, and from right to left on the response. Since you define the order, and since you can define as many <a href=\"https://docs.traefik.io/middlewares/chain/\">chains</a> or attach as many pieces of middleware to your <a href=\"https://docs.traefik.io/routing/routers/\">routers</a> as you want, you have total control. There are currently no available middleware for TCP routers, but it’s something we’re looking into (if you have ideas, let us know!). And regarding custom middleware, even though we know our user base is looking for it, it won’t fit in the 2.0 scope (which is already big!).</p><h3 id=\"about-kv-stores-distributed-let-s-encrypt\">About KV Stores &amp; Distributed Let’s Encrypt</h3><blockquote><em><em>Current (pre-2.0) traefik can store ACME certificates in a file or a KV store. The latter helps with running a cluster of traefik, but the storage is restricted to 512kb of certificate information when using Consul. Will this improve? (storing in a key per certificate instead of a single key for all, for example)</em></em></blockquote><p>While working on 2.0, we decided it was time to rework this part. Sticking with the Unix Philosophy, “Make each program do one thing well,” Traefik is getting back to be a good old single-instance pure data plane. At the same time, clustering has been redesigned from scratch using a production-proven rock-solid raft-based implementation, shipped with Traefik Enterprise Edition (<a href=\"https://containous.ghost.io/blog/the-journey-to-traefik-enterprise-edition-https-for-everyone-90a36b33600/\">see how</a>). Distributed features (like Let’s Encrypt) can now rely on this advanced cluster technology for these use cases. But hey! You can still use multiple Traefik instances with your favorite KV store, we only removed the unstable and experimental part :)</p><h3 id=\"about-the-final-release\">About the Final Release</h3><blockquote><em><em>When will the final 2.0 be available?</em></em></blockquote><p>Short answer: When it’s ready!</p><p>Real answer: We wish we could tell. Even though we can estimate how much time we will need to develop the <a href=\"https://github.com/containous/traefik/projects/3\" rel=\"noopener\">missing features</a>, we don’t know fore sure how much feedback you’ll provide, or how many features contributors will be tackling (and, as Damien pointed out — we’re ready to help any [new/returning/existing] contributors eager to participate in the project!).

Of course,\neverything that applies to the file provider should apply to the\nlabel/annotation based providers.\n\nNote 2: In this article, we’ll assume that you’re a knowledgeable Traefik\nenthusiast.\n\nNote 3: Nope, no note 3, I’m good, let’s move on.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt All Started with…\nTo this day, Traefik’s configuration is quite simple and accounts for a great\npart of its success.\n\nEntrypoints accept the incoming requests (for the most part: ports & certificate\nmanagement), frontends analyze the requests to determine what should handle\nthem, and backends are responsible for forwarding the requests to your system\n(your both beloved and hated microservices).\n\nSince everyone loves diagrams (at least I do), below is the magic happening.\n\nThis architecture works like a charm because you can configure everything you\nneed, from authentication to redirects, to circuit breaker mechanisms, to retry\nmechanisms, to custom errors, to HTTPS, to load-balancing, to whatever you need.\nAnd better, it works with many providers (k8s, docker, AWS, mesos, …).\n\nBut … (always a but) … sometimes people were confused about where to configure\nthese options. Other times, people were confused because some options were\nmagically applied in a predetermined order they could not easily change (and no,\nhacking our way into the bowels of Traefik is not literally easy).\n\nBecause so many options were added since Traefik’s initial launch, we’re in a\nsituation where the magic comes along with a cost: things are less obvious than\nbefore, and it becomes a problem when you need to fine-tune the routing for\nspecific requests.\n\nAlso, since we’re complaining about the configuration, I have to say that I hate\nto repeat myself — which was sometimes a problem when (for example) I wanted to\nput the same auth mechanism on several frontends (but not every one of them).\n\n… And It Will Become\nSo we took a step back, gave it some thought, and came up with our first\nproposal … What if we wrote…\n\nEntrypoints accept the incoming requests, routers analyze the requests to\ndetermine what should handle them, and services are responsible for handling the\nrequests and ultimately forwarding them to your system (your both beloved and\nhated microservices).\n\n> Déjà vu?\nSee? SO different! It’s even more obvious in the following diagram.\n\nAre You Kidding?\nWell, we’re not.\n\nAt first sight, apart from the vocabulary update, we agree that nothing has \nobviously changed: same sequence of operations.\n\nWhat really changed is what’s happening inside.\n\nMiddleware — The (Almost) Newcomer\nIf you look closely to the new diagram, you’ll notice that something is missing,\nand then you’ll realize that this something is quite important.\n\nYou can pause here, go back to the diagram and keep reading once you’ve figured\nit out, but for the impatient amongst us, here it is: In the diagram, nothing \nupdates the request, nothing checks the credentials, nothing tweaks the path or\nthe domain. In the diagram, a whole block of features is missing.\n\nBut how come this crucial element isn’t shouting its absence from the diagram?\nIt’s simply because the configuration for these updates/tweaks/behaviors used to\nbe spread across the existing components (entrypoints, frontends, and backends).\n\nSoon, they will be configured in dedicated pieces of middleware and referred to\nfrom entrypoints, routers, and services. What’s more important — You will decide\nhow, when, and in which order.\n\n> Yes, you will have full control.\nBefore / After (The TL;DR you’re looking for)\nWe Want Examples!\nThat’s a legitimate request — let’s start with a super basic example with a\nfrontend, a backend, and no additional fluff.\n\n> A frontend (router), a backend (service), and no additional fluff\nbefore\n[frontends]\n   [frontends.my-frontend]\n      entrypoint = [\"http\"]\n      backend = my-backend\n      [frontend.my-frontend.routes.route1]\n         rule = \"Host:myhost.com\"\n\n[backends]\n   [backends.my-backend]\n      [backends.my-backend1.servers]          \n         [backends.backend1.servers.server-1]\n            url = \"http://xx.xx.xx.xx\"\n\nafter\n[routers]\n   [routers.my-router]\n      entrypoint = [\"http\"]\n      rule = \"Host:myhost.com\"\n      service = my-service\n\n[services]\n   [services.my-service.load-balancer]\n      [[services.my-services.load-balancer.servers]]\n         url = \"http://xx.xx.xx.xx\"\n\nApart from the vocabulary difference, this one brings nothing new to the table.\n(Yes, I’ll behave as if there was no additional .load-balancer type for the\nservice because this will be for another episode.)\n\nIf we wanted to have another server, of course, we would write:\n\n[routers]\n   [routers.my-router]\n      entrypoint = [\"http\"]\n      rule = \"Host:myhost.com\"\n      service = my-service\n\n[services]\n   [services.my-service.load-balancer]\n      [[services.my-services.load-balancer.servers]]\n         url = \"http://xx.xx.xx.xx\"\n      [[services.my-services.load-balancer.servers]]\n         url = \"http://xx.xx.xx.xx\"\n\n> Now, let’s add basic authentication!\nbefore\n[frontends]\n   [frontends.my-frontend]\n      entrypoint = [\"http\"]\n      backend = my-backend\n      [frontend.my-frontend.routes.route1]\n         rule = \"Host:myhost.com\"\n      [frontend.my-frontend.auth]\n         [frontend.my-frontend.auth.basic]\n            users = [\"admin:xxx\",\"super-admin:xxx\",]\n\n[backends]\n   [backends.my-backend]\n      [backends.my-backend1.servers]          \n         [backends.backend1.servers.server-1]\n            url = \"http://xx.xx.xx.xx\"\n\nafter\n[routers]\n   [routers.my-router]\n      entrypoint = [\"http\"]\n      rule = \"Host:myhost.com\"\n      middlewares = [\"admins-only\"]\n      service = my-service\n\n[middlewares]\n   [middlewares.admins-only.basicauth]\n      users = [\"admin:xxx\",\"super-admin:xxx\",]\n\n[services]\n   [services.my-service.load-balancer]\n      [[services.my-services.load-balancer.servers]]\n         url = \"http://xx.xx.xx.xx\"\n\nThe basic authentication middleware is no longer configured inside the router\nbut in a dedicated middleware section. The good news, besides readability, is\nthat you can now reuse the same middleware in a different router, along with\nother middlewares.\n\n[routers]\n   [routers.my-router]\n      entrypoint = [\"http\"]\n      rule = \"Host:myhost.com\"\n      middlewares = [\"admins-only\"]\n      service = my-service\n   \n   [routers.my-other-router]\n      entrypoint = [\"http\"]\n      rule = \"Host:myhost2.com\"\n      middlewares = [\"admins-only\", \"retry-std\"]\n      service = my-service\n\n[middlewares]\n   [middlewares.admins-only.basicauth]\n      users = [\"admin:xxx\",\"super-admin:xxx\",]\n   [middlewares.retry-std.retry]\n      attempts = 2\n\n[services]\n   [services.my-service.load-balancer]\n      [[services.my-services.load-balancer.servers]]\n         url = \"http://xx.xx.xx.xx\"\n\nAlso, another benefit you probably have noticed — you can now have many separate\nconfigurations for some features (like retry) and choose the one that fits for\nyour routers.\n\nBehind the scenes, many other things have already changed (not yet obvious), but\nwe’d like to tease with more episodes!\n\nBesides, we’ve decided to show you one “work in progress” feature at a time —\nthis gives time to listen to your feedback!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTraefik is a project driven by the community!
