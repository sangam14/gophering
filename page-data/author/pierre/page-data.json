Today, we’re announcing that Traefik Pilot\n1.0 is available and ready to connect with all Traefik instances, everywhere.\n\nTraefik is known for its extensive compatibility with third-party vendors and\nits ability to adapt to multiple topologies. Traefik Pilot extends this\nflexibility and ease-of-use beyond the data center to provide a similar\nexperience for the entire ecosystem of components that make up a complete\napplication. It achieves this in a number of ways.\n\nFirst, Traefik Pilot provides visibility into cloud-native architectures.\nContainerized applications and microservices are dynamic by nature, and they\ntypically involve multiple network connections linking diverse components. Apps\nteams want to know what is happening within their installations: to visualize\nthe history and durations of requests, to analyze changes in behavior, and to\nsee when load has peaked and for how long. Such capabilities are essential to\npinpoint the root causes of issues within the infrastructure.\n\nWhile visibility is good, however, being notified or alerted is better. Traefik\nPilot’s timely alerts allow operators to mitigate issues, apply processes, or\nanalyze anomalous situations in real time, which leads to higher availability\nand improved end user experience.\n\nIn addition to these features, Traefik Pilot also introduces the ability for\nTraefik operators to create their own plugins\n[https://traefik.io/blog/unleash-custom-networking-logic-with-traefik-plugins/],\nincluding custom middlewares, and easily find and share plugins with others\nthrough the Traefik Pilot online plugin catalog.\n\nTraefik Pilot 1.0 brings a number of enhancements since the release candidate.\nLet’s take a look at some of the most significant ones.\n\nImproved web UI\nWe heard users’ feedback from the preview release, and as a result, we have\ntransformed the UI to make the Traefik Pilot user experience even more\nstraightforward. We think you’ll agree that these modifications allow everyone\nto use Traefik Pilot in the most natural way possible.\n\nNew metrics dashboard\nWould you like metrics for your Traefik instances? Just connect your instances\nto Traefik Pilot, and voilà!\n\nStarting today, all instances registered in Traefik Pilot will benefit from this\nnew feature, which allows you to diagnose and record changes in the usage of the\ninstances or services behind Traefik through graphs spanning a day, a week, or a\nmonth.\n\nEnhanced alerts\nTraefik Pilot 1.0 offers two types of alerts. They can be enabled in your\nprofile settings and can be delivered either by email or through a webhook.\n\nFirst, Traefik Pilot can notify you when a Traefik instance no longer has access\nto the internet. If a connected Traefik instance fails to contact Traefik Pilot\nfor 5 minutes, it will be marked as unreachable in the Traefik Pilot dashboard.\nIf the instance still does not contact Traefik Pilot after 10 minutes, the\ninstance will disappear from the dashboard and you will be notified of the lack\nof connectivity..\n\nTraefik Pilot can also raise an alert when a security vulnerability is found in\nTraefik. Starting today, for any CVE involving Traefik, if your instance is\nconnected to Traefik Pilot and is vulnerable, you will receive a notification\nthrough the same communication channels.\n\nGrowing plugin ecosystem\nSince the preview release, Traefik Pilot has made it possible to extend the\nfunctionality of Traefik with plugins. We are proud and encouraged to see the\nplugins that have already been created by the community.\n\nPlugins are a feature that opens up a wide range of possibilities with Traefik.\nAlthough this feature is still experimental, we are looking forward to seeing\nhow the community around plugins continues to grow. To learn more about creating\nyour own plugins, consult the developer documentation\n[https://github.com/traefik/plugindemo].\n\nOnward and upward\nWe have a lot of ideas for the continuation of Traefik Pilot, including\nadditional types of alerts and more. \n\nOne particular area of focus is on multi-cluster management, with the aim of\nmaking it possible to easily manage multiple datacenters. Because most (but not\nall) HTTP traffic is now encrypted with TLS, we plan to provide tools for\nTraefik Pilot to simplify certificate management. \n\nWe are also working on connecting Traefik Enterprise to Traefik Pilot, to bring\nall the features of Traefik Pilot to your Traefik Enterprise instances. \n\nFinally, there will probably be one or more surprises. For now, we hope you\nenjoy all the features that Traefik Pilot 1.0 [https://pilot.traefik.io/] has to\noffer, and we welcome your feedback\n[https://community.traefik.io/c/traefik-pilot/18].\n\nUseful links\n * Traefik Pilot [https://traefik.io/traefik-pilot]\n * Get started [https://pilot.traefik.io/]\n * Pilot documentation [https://docs.traefik.io/v2.3/plugins/overview/]\n * Traefik [https://traefik.io/traefik/]\n * Community forum [https://community.containo.us/c/traefik/5]","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://containous.ghost.io/content/images/2020/09/Traefik-Pilot-the-control-center-for-Traefik.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Introducing Traefik Pilot 1.0: the Traefik Control Center\" srcset=\"https://containous.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Traefik-Pilot-the-control-center-for-Traefik.jpg 600w, https://containous.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/Traefik-Pilot-the-control-center-for-Traefik.jpg 1000w, https://containous.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/Traefik-Pilot-the-control-center-for-Traefik.jpg 1600w, https://containous.ghost.io/content/images/2020/09/Traefik-Pilot-the-control-center-for-Traefik.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>In July, we debuted a <a href=\"https://traefik.io/blog/introducing-traefik-pilot-a-first-look-at-our-new-saas-control-platform-for-traefik/\">preview release</a> of <a href=\"https://traefik.io/traefik-pilot/\">Traefik Pilot</a>, a new SaaS platform that extends the functionality of Traefik.
