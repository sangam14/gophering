His name is \nVincent Pineau [https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincent-pineau-143898/], a tech\nveteran who has successfully lead two companies to the win. One, Talend, the\nthird French company to make it to the NASDAQ, and the second, Influans, a\ncompany recently acquired. Vincent joined our small and dedicated leadership\nteam as CCO, standing alongside Emile Vauge [https://twitter.com/emilevauge],\nfounder and CEO of Containous, and the inventor of Traefik [/traefik/], a world\nclass, cloud native edge router.\n\nVincent and I have a highly collaborative relationship around my marketing\nefforts. Here, I ask him questions to better understand his vision for the\ncompany, and how he’ll lead us to becoming globally recognized, and trusted for\nour brand, products and customer service. Please read on.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Interview\nVincent Pineau, Chief Customer Officer, ContainousPatricia: What is your title at Containous, and function does this role play?\n\nVincent: I am the new “CCO,” which stands for Chief Customer Officer, although\ntitles aren’t very important to us. More meaningful than a title is a person’s\nfocus. My focus is to extend Containous from the amazing open source company\nthat it is, to an open source business. I am responsible for putting together\nand to oversee, the appropriate programs and services to grow the business. I\nwill enable our expansion, from a customer support, sales and marketing\nstandpoint.\n\nPatricia: What does such an expansion look like?\n\nVincent: First, we will continue to develop products which are easy and relevant\nto the quickly evolving IT infrastructure world. Then, we’ll hone in on what our\ncustomers, and the open source community needs to drive the most value out of\nour products. Commercial support, expertise consulting, advanced training,\nspecific “enterprise grade” capabilities, those are the key variables that I’ve\nseen leveraged in the past to build sustainable open source companies…which is\nexactly what Containous will become.\n\nPatricia: Wait. So. What’s your background?\n\nVincent: As a quick study, I was part of the founding team that grew one company\nto an IPO on the NASDAQ, and co-founder of another company which was acquired\nlate 2018. To give you the full story, we have to go back a little bit and\nexplain my journey in tech. I had my first computer when I was 10. You know my\nage, so that takes us back a while.\n\nPatricia: Do I know your age? I don’t.\n\nVincent: I just turned 50 in January. I had a computer in ’79, and I was\nprobably one of the first dozen in the area of Lyon to have a computer. As a\ncurious kid, I started tinkering with computers. I came to have several of them\nand then as a teenager, had to choose a major. After some deliberation, I chose\nto focus on mechanics.\n\nThe computers, everything IT related, became a passion, but I earned my major in\nmechanical engineering. The team at my first job figured out very quickly that\nmy value was in IT, not acting as a mechanical engineer. Eventually, I became\nthe IT Director there. I implemented an ERP solution, and was quickly hired by\nthe vendor to become a consultant.\n\nThat’s when I discovered the “vendor” side, which quickly brought me to the U.S.\nAfter about a decade working for traditional enterprise vendors, I was\nintroduced to a French open source company, Talend, and given the opportunity to\nlaunch it globally. That meant taking an open source company which was having a\nfair amount of organic traction, acting as an evangelist, and bringing attention\nto the company, with the goal of turning existing users into customers.\n\nThat journey started in 2007, when commercial open source was still being\nestablished in the U.S.\n\nDuring that time frame, I spent a lot of time explaining to customers the\nadvantages of open source.\n\n> I don’t believe in open source being at odds with proprietary software.\nGenerally, I believe that open source is superior, because it is the result of a\ncommunity driven focus.\nYou benefit from lots of brains — which brings stability, an edge in creativity,\nan edge in time to market. Those elements together are superior.\n\nPatricia: What does the future hold for Traefik?\n\nVincent: I see wonderful opportunities here. When I was with Talend, we had a\nsimilar opportunity with similar challenges. We started as a small team in\nFrance, with a small amount of funding. We became serious about bringing the\nproduct to market, and my charter was to raise awareness to a global\nmarketplace, not just Europe.\n\nWe have a similar story with Containous, in that it has substantial organic\ngrowth and humble beginnings. Now, we going for the gold by dedicating more\ndeveloper, marketing and community resources to growing the company. We will\nbring not just Traefik open source edition more visibility, but expose the value\nof Traefik Enterprise Edition [/traefikee/] to a worldwide audience.\n\nI am excited to create an evolution. Containous is a mind blowing company with a\nthoroughness that the team is proving through the development of high quality\nsoftware.\n\n> We will show why we’re worth getting to know.\nWe are creating a technical evolution, beginning with Traefik and Traefik\nEnterprise Edition. I’m excited to lead us into creating it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor those interested in free early access to Traefik Enterprise Edition,\n[/traefikee/] and to those already using Traefik in production who wish to share\nyour stories, please email me: patricia at containo.us.\n\nThank you.","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p class=\"post-sub-title\">An Interview with New Leadership at Containous</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>We recently welcomed new leadership to the <a href=\"https://containous.ghost.io/\" rel=\"noopener\">Containous</a> team.
