Thus, you can reduce the workload on your services for most\nHTTP requests.\n\nYou just have to set this middleware on your router and Traefik Enterprise will\nstart improving your response times automatically:\n\n# Dynamic Configuration\nhttp:\n  middlewares:\n    test-http-cache:\n      plugin:\n        httpCache:\n          maxTtl: 600\n          memory:\n            limit: \"3Gi\"\n\n\nAPI Portal for Developers\nDeploying a microservice architecture means managing infrastructure with many\nAPIs. These APIs are typically provided by multiple teams in the organization\nand they are often exposed to external partners.\n\nBut how to share the APIs information with all the involved parties? That's\nwhere Traefik Enterprise 2.3 comes in. \n\nWith this new release, you need only describe your APIs’ specifications in the\npopular OpenAPI [https://www.openapis.org/] format and expose them using Traefik\nEnterprise’s new API portal feature:\n\n# Static Configuration\napiportal:\n  url: spec.json\n\n\nWith just a few lines of configuration, your API specification is reachable from\nyour service.\n\nNeed to monitor all your APIs at a glance?

This\nlatest release includes integrated service mesh capabilities, an improved web\nUI, support for OpenID Connect authentication, and more.\n\nIntegrated Service Mesh\nManaging a microservice architecture built on Kubernetes requires dealing with\nexternal and internal connections (sometimes called north-south and east-west\nconnections, respectively). An ingress controller is the software that routes\nthe north-south connections from the external network, while a service mesh is\nthe increasingly popular choice for managing east-west connections between\nservices on the internal network..\n\nThe usual case is to split the responsibilities between a separate ingress\ncontroller and service mesh. But the downside of this architecture is that it\nmeans that you have to install, configure, and maintain two different tools,\noften with very different capabilities and configuration styles.\n\nThat's where Traefik Enterprise 2.2 comes in.\n\nTraefik Enterprise can now act as both a Kubernetes ingress controller, based on\nthe well-known Traefik edge router, and a service mesh based on Traefik Mesh,\nthe lightweight and simpler service mesh.\n\nThus, Traefik Enterprise simplifies your workflow:\n\n * It enables you to install both your ingress controller and your service mesh\n   with a single command\n * It requires a single configuration file to manage them together\n * It comes with a dashboard to monitor your whole network environment easily\n\nTraefik Enterprise’s service mesh is designed to be non-invasive. It requires no\nsidecar containers and does not modify your Kubernetes objects, and it’s 100%\nopt-in.\n\nTake advantage of this feature by following the comprehensive guide in the\ndocumentation.\n[https://doc.traefik.io/traefik-enterprise/operations/service-mesh/]\n\nImproved WebUI\nThe key to managing microservices infrastructure is monitoring. You can’t fix\nthe problems in your infrastructure if you don’t know what and where they are.\n\nTo this end, we’ve updated the Traefik Enterprise dashboard with features that\nallow you to monitor your cluster alerts at a glance.\n\nIf an error occurs in your cluster, your services, routers, or middlewares\nconfiguration, it will be reported on the new welcome page. From there, you will\nbe able to navigate to the error source to fix it.\n\nAdditionally, if you choose to enable the new service mesh option, Traefik\nEnterprise 2.2’s enhanced dashboard provides a diagram to monitor your service\nmesh connections.\n\nUsing it, you won't have to read through all of your Kubernetes configuration\nfiles to know why your Kubernetes services don’t communicate as expected!\n\nOpenID Connect\nWhether you expose one API or hundreds, if you want to sleep well at night, you\nwill have to secure your infrastructure. Authentication is a critical component\nof this.\n\nTraefik Enterprise has acknowledged this need. That's why, on top of the\nexisting authentication middlewares (such as LDAP, OAuth 2.0 token\nintrospection, and JWT), v2.2 adds a new OpenID Connect (OIDC) middleware\n[https://doc.traefik.io/traefik-enterprise/middlewares/oidc/].\n\nOIDC [https://openid.net/connect/] is a very popular framework built on top of\nOAuth 2.0 to handle authentication workflows.\n\nUsing the OIDC middleware, you'll secure your applications by delegating the\nauthentication to an external provider (such as GitHub, Google Accounts,\nLinkedIn, etc.) with a straightforward configuration. Here’s an example:\n\nhttp:\nmiddlewares:\nmyoidc:\nplugin:\noidcAuth:\nsource: googleSource\nredirectUrl: example.com/callback\nsession:\nsecret: mysupersecret123\n\n\nSecuring a service couldn’t be easier.\n\nTraefik Enterprise provider\nOne of the main advantages of Traefik Enterprise has always been the dynamic\nconfiguration. Are you a Kubernetes user? Create a CRD, and let the magic\nhappen. Docker user? Add labels to your container… et voilà!\n\nBut if you are a bare metal user, so far you have had to share your\nconfiguration file between machines manually.

This latest release includes integrated service mesh capabilities, an improved web UI, support for OpenID Connect authentication, and more.</p><h2 id=\"integrated-service-mesh\"><strong>Integrated Service Mesh</strong></h2><p>Managing a microservice architecture built on Kubernetes requires dealing with external and internal connections (sometimes called north-south and east-west connections, respectively). An ingress controller is the software that routes the north-south connections from the external network, while a service mesh is the increasingly popular choice for managing east-west connections between services on the internal network..</p><p>The usual case is to split the responsibilities between a separate ingress controller and service mesh. But the downside of this architecture is that it means that you have to install, configure, and maintain two different tools, often with very different capabilities and configuration styles.</p><p>That's where Traefik Enterprise 2.2 comes in.</p><p>Traefik Enterprise can now act as both a Kubernetes ingress controller, based on the well-known Traefik edge router, and a service mesh based on Traefik Mesh, the lightweight and simpler service mesh.</p><p>Thus, Traefik Enterprise simplifies your workflow:</p><ul><li>It enables you to install both your ingress controller and your service mesh with a single command</li><li>It requires a single configuration file to manage them together</li><li>It comes with a dashboard to monitor your whole network environment easily</li></ul><p>Traefik Enterprise’s service mesh is designed to be non-invasive. It requires no sidecar containers and does not modify your Kubernetes objects, and it’s 100% opt-in.</p><p>Take advantage of this feature by following <a href=\"https://doc.traefik.io/traefik-enterprise/operations/service-mesh/\">the comprehensive guide in the documentation.</a></p><h2 id=\"improved-webui\"><strong>Improved WebUI</strong></h2><p>The key to managing microservices infrastructure is monitoring. You can’t fix the problems in your infrastructure if you don’t know what and where they are.</p><p>To this end, we’ve updated the Traefik Enterprise dashboard with features that allow you to monitor your cluster alerts at a glance.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jwBeNWko1GGuIZSIC4yhBQgNXQ4CI6PW2W_61Y25aaHfFTvWrHIzfUydIU-N8freBJ_WvHVvxir6UuEocZqfPzo0STBnEN__bQaa_mP_WpDJASJQ9E_m3vSrBtf97oAs8madpsk\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Traefik Enteprise WebUI Dashboard\"></figure><p>If an error occurs in your cluster, your services, routers, or middlewares configuration, it will be reported on the new welcome page.

Authentication is a critical component of this.</p><p>Traefik Enterprise has acknowledged this need. That's why, on top of the existing authentication middlewares (such as LDAP, OAuth 2.0 token introspection, and JWT), v2.2 adds a new <a href=\"https://doc.traefik.io/traefik-enterprise/middlewares/oidc/\">OpenID Connect (OIDC) middleware</a>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><a href=\"https://openid.net/connect/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">OIDC</a> is a very popular framework built on top of OAuth 2.0 to handle authentication workflows.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Using the OIDC middleware, you'll secure your applications by delegating the authentication to an external provider (such as GitHub, Google Accounts, LinkedIn, etc.) with a straightforward configuration. Here’s an example:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">http:\nmiddlewares:\nmyoidc:\nplugin:\noidcAuth:\nsource: googleSource\nredirectUrl: example.com/callback\nsession:\nsecret: mysupersecret123\n</code></pre>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Securing a service couldn’t be easier.</p><h2 id=\"traefik-enterprise-provider\"><strong>Traefik Enterprise provider</strong></h2><p>One of the main advantages of Traefik Enterprise has always been the dynamic configuration. Are you a Kubernetes user? Create a CRD, and let the magic happen. Docker user? Add labels to your container… et voilà!</p><p>But if you are a bare metal user, so far you have had to share your configuration file between machines manually. To ease your work, Traefik Enterprise 2.2 includes a new internal provider that allows you to set your configuration using the teectl CLI.</p><p>You need only execute one command and your cluster is automatically updated.

Thus, users can set a cluster as the active one\nand not provide its name in each command.\n\nRed Hat OpenShift Operator Certified\nLike Traefik, TraefikEE eases your Ingress Controller integration regardless of\nyour infrastructure, including Red Hat OpenShift clusters!\n\nStarting with TraefikEE v2.0, we introduced a Kubernetes Operator to install\nTraefikEE into OpenShift v4 clusters.\n\nToday, we are proud to announce that TraefikEE v2.1 is Red Hat OpenShift\nOperator certified. With this certification, TraefikEE joins the Red Hat\nsoftware certified partner ecosystem and is readily available through the Red\nHat OpenShift Container Platform\n[https://www.openshift.com/products/container-platform].\n\nThe TraefikEE Operator is now available in the Red Hat Container Catalog\n[https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/explore]. Via OperatorHub\n[https://operatorhub.io/operator/traefikee-operator], you can install and update\nTraefikEE quickly and seamlessly into any OpenShift cluster.\n\nWhat's Next?\nTraefikEE continues to bring more enterprise specific features.

Behind the scenes,\nthis is achieved through the Raft consensus algorithm that allows recovery from\ncomponent failure.\n\nBut we know from experience, that in some extreme scenarios which combine heavy\nnetwork latency, multiple failures, and scheduled operations, the quorum of\nnormal state can be lost.\n\nFor this very reason, with TraefikEE 2.0 we've improved the resilience to a\ntemporary quorum loss, and we've introduced a mechanism to enable the cluster to\nrecover – without any downtime – from a single working instance of the\ncontrollers, and all it takes is a single command line\n[https://docs.containo.us/operating/disaster-recovery/].\n\nLDAP Authentication\nDeploying APIs on your cluster often comes with the necessity to manage\ncredentials, either for your business partners or for your teams. And the more\nAPIs you deploy, the more you engage in microservice architectures, the more API\nmanagement becomes part of your workflow.\n\nWith TraefikEE, we've introduced a way to simplify and centralize authentication\nwith the ability to connect with an LDAP server\n[https://docs.containo.us/middlewares/ldap/].\n\nDeclare users, groups, and credentials in your directory, then have TraefikEE\ndeal with authorization on your behalf.\n\nIn the following example, we're connecting TraefikEE to our LDAP server. Then we\nattach a rule to our service so that only users from the authorized group (with\nthe group id 500) can use our API.\n\n# Static Configuration\nauthSources:\n  mySource:\n    ldap:\n      url: ldap://ldap.server.addr:389\n\n\nversion: '3.4'\nservices:\n  whoami:\n    image: containous/whoami\n    deploy:\n      labels:\n        # Dynamic Configuration\n        - \"traefik.http.routers.whoami.rule=Path(`/whoami`)\"\n        - \"traefik.http.routers.whoami.service=whoami\"\n        - \"traefik.http.services.whoami.loadbalancer.server.port=80\"\n        - \"traefik.http.routers.whoami.middlewares=mymiddleware\"\n        - \"traefik.http.middlewares.mymiddleware.plugin.ldapauth.source=mySource\"\n        - \"traefik.http.middlewares.mymiddleware.plugin.ldapauth.baseDN=dc=example,dc=org\"\n        - \"traefik.http.middlewares.mymiddleware.plugin.ldapAuth.searchFilter=(&(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)(gidNumber=500)(uid=%s))\"\n\n\nCustomization Made Easy\nThe premise with TraefikEE is that you can setup a cluster of Traefik in one\nsingle command line, saving you hours of configuration decisions. But since no\ninfrastructure is the same, some users needed a way to customize many aspects of\ntheir architecture during installation.\n\nTraefikEE 2.0 still comes with a default setup command and it's now possible to\ngenerate a pre-configured manifest before the actual installation. With this\nmanifest, users are able to see every available configuration option and tweak\nevery parameter.\n\nOf course, each manifest is specific to the orchestrator, whether you use Swarm\n[https://docs.containo.us/installing/swarm/] or Kubernetes\n[https://docs.containo.us/installing/kubernetes/].\n\nDynamic TLS Certificates Management\nTraefikEE has always been fully integrated with Let’s Encrypt\n[https://docs.containo.us/operating/acme/], which has enabled many users to\nautomate certificate generation throughout their cluster.\n\nBut operating a cluster with many applications also means you have to deal with\nother certificates, whether in-house or bought separately. For such situations,\nTraefikEE comes with a command line to deploy them dynamically\n[https://docs.containo.us/operating/tls/].\n\nIn the following example, we’re adding a whoami.example.com certificate to the\ncluster.\n\n$ teectl create tls-cert --cert=mycrt.pem --key=mykey.prem\n$ teectl get tls-cert\nID     CN                  SANs  NOT AFTER             STORE    DEFAULT\nu7vxw  whoami.example.com        2022-01-22T15:27:25Z  default  false\n\n\nCLI 2.0\nOperating a Traefik cluster means being able to operate, configure,\nre-configure, stop and start proxies at will, wherever they are hosted in your\ninfrastructure -- and TraefikEE embeds a CLI (teectl\n[https://docs.containo.us/references/cli/teectl/]) for this purpose.\n\nWe saw the command line growing to become the main user interface for\nadministrators, and decided it was time to tweak its grammar for more\nconsistency.\n\nNow (like in Kubernetes), you’ll create, get or delete resources to and from\nyour TraefikEE cluster, like in the previous TLS example.\n\nRedesigned Web UI\nInspired by Traefik, the Web UI allows users to have an overview of their\ncluster's health with just a glance.\n\nThe welcome page contains all the main information. It's the starting point from\nwhich you’ll access all the cluster details.\n\nWhat's Next?\nAs you can see, TraefikEE not only adds a clustering system on top of Traefik,\nbut it contains additional features designed for enterprise and a CLI to operate\nthe cluster.\n\nThere are many benefits you can get from switching to TraefikEE, and the best is\nthat you can test it for yourself and request a free trial license on our\nwebsite\n[https://info.containo.us/get-traefik-enterprise-edition-free-for-30-days] (and\nto make it simple, the TraefikEE configuration is fully compatible with your\nexisting Traefik configuration).\n\nAnd if you still have questions or need help finding a tailored option for your\ninfrastructure, we’ll be happy to discuss it with you, and to help you find the\nbest solution for your use case\n[https://info.containo.us/request-demo-traefikee].\n\nTry it today\n[https://info.containo.us/get-traefik-enterprise-edition-free-for-30-days], and\nbe sure that we'll continue to pack TraefikEE with new features driven by\ncompanies' needs... to make networking boring!","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p class=\"post-sub-title\">Twice The High Availability, Scalability, and Security</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://containous.ghost.io/content/images/2020/02/Containous-TraefikEE-2-0-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Four months after we launched <a href=\"https://containous.ghost.io/blog/traefik-2-0-6531ec5196c2/\">Traefik v2.0</a>, we're happy to announce that the <a href=\"https://info.containo.us/get-traefik-enterprise-edition-free-for-30-days\">Enterprise Edition is now available</a>, and it is loaded with Enterprise specific features!</p><p>On top of enabling our users to leverage the <a href=\"https://containous.ghost.io/blog/traefik-2-1-in-the-wild/\">2.1 feature set</a> (TCP routing, middleware, canary, mirroring, enhanced rule syntax, etc.), the Enterprise Edition keeps helping our customers to set up highly available, scalable, and distributed systems.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-in-traefikee-2-0\"><strong>What's in TraefikEE 2.0?</strong></h2><h3 id=\"improved-high-availability\">Improved High Availability</h3><p>One of the core values behind Traefik Enterprise Edition is to secure our customers' infrastructure with a highly available solution.
