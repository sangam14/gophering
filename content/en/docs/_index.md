Some of the methods have been implemented and you can find the implementation in Notebook tab.

Previous work showed that during training, DNNs tend to learn simple patterns first, then gradually memorize all samples [ref](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05394).
n recent years, deep learning has made impressive progress
in the classification task. The success of deep neural networks is based on the large scale datasets with a tremendous
amount of labeled samples (Deng et al. 2009).
However, in
many practical situations, a large number of labeled samples
are inaccessible.
